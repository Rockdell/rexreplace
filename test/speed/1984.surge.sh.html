<p class="p noindent" data-line="11"><span data-line="11"></span>It  was  a  bright  cold day in April, and the clocks were
        striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his  chin  nuzzled  into  his
        breast  in  an  effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly
        through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly
        enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust  from  entering  along
        with him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="18"><span data-line="18"></span>The  hallway  smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At
        one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor  display,
        had  been  tacked  to  the wall. It depicted simply an enormous
        face, more than a metre wide:  the  face  of  a  man  of  about
        forty-five,  with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome
        features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the
        lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working,  and  at
        present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours.
        It  was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.
        The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine
        and had a varicose ulcer above his right  ankle,  went  slowly,
        resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the
        lift-shaft,  the  poster  with the enormous face gazed from the
        wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived  that
        the  eyes  follow  you  about  when  you  move.  BIG BROTHER IS
        WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="35"><span data-line="35"></span>Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a  list  of
        figures  which  had  something  to  do  with  the production of
        pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong  metal  plaque  like  a
        dulled   mirror  which  formed  part  of  the  surface  of  the
        right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch  and  the  voice  sank
        somewhat,  though  the  words  were  still distinguishable. The
        instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but
        there was no way of shutting it off completely. He  moved  over
        to  the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his
        body merely emphasized by the  blue  overalls  which  were  the
        uniform  of  the  party.  His  hair  was  very  fair,  his face
        naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt
        razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="49"><span data-line="49"></span>Outside, even through  the  shut  window-pane,  the  world
        looked  cold.  Down  in  the  street little eddies of wind were
        whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though  the  sun
        was  shining  and  the  sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no
        colour in anything, except  the  posters  that  were  plastered
        everywhere.  The  blackmoustachio<span data-line="54"></span>&#39;<span data-line="54"></span>d  face gazed down from every
        commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately
        opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said,  while
        the   dark  eyes  looked  deep  into  Winston<span data-line="57"></span>&#39;<span data-line="57"></span>s  own.  Down  at
        streetlevel  another  poster,  torn  at  one  corner,   flapped
        fitfully  in  the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the
        single word INGSOC. In the far distance  a  helicopter  skimmed
        down   between  the  roofs,  hovered  for  an  instant  like  a
        bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was
        the police patrol, snooping into people<span data-line="63"></span>&#39;<span data-line="63"></span>s windows. The  patrols
        did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="66"><span data-line="66"></span>Behind  Winston<span data-line="66"></span>&#39;<span data-line="66"></span>s  back  the voice from the telescreen was
        still babbling away about pig-iron and  the  overfulfilment  of
        the   Ninth   Three-Year  Plan.  The  telescreen  received  and
        transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made,  above
        the  level  of  a  very  low whisper, would be picked up by it,
        moreover, so long as he remained within  the  field  of  vision
        which  the  metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as
        heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether  you  were
        being  watched  at  any  given  moment.  How  often, or on what
        system, the Thought Police plugged in on  any  individual  wire
        was  guesswork.  It  was  even  conceivable  that  they watched
        everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your
        wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live — did live, from
        habit that became instinct —  in  the  assumption  that  every
        sound  you  made  was overheard, and, except in darkness, every
        movement scrutinized.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="83"><span data-line="83"></span>Winston kept his back turned to  the  telescreen.  It  was
        safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A
        kilometre  away  the  Ministry  of  Truth,  his  place of work,
        towered vast and white above  the  grimy  landscape.  This,  he
        thought with a sort of vague distaste — this was London, chief
        city  of  Airstrip  One,  itself the third most populous of the
        provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze  out  some  childhood
        memory  that  should  tell  him  whether London had always been
        quite like this. Were there  always  these  vistas  of  rotting
        nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of
        timber,  their  windows  patched with cardboard and their roofs
        with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging  in  all
        directions? And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled
        in  the  air  and  the  willow-herb straggled over the heaps of
        rubble; and the places where the bombs  had  cleared  a  larger
        patch  and  there  had  sprung  up  sordid  colonies  of wooden
        dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could  not
        remember:  nothing remained of his childhood except a series of
        bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and  mostly
        unintelligible.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="104"><span data-line="104"></span>The  Ministry  of  Truth  — Minitrue, in Newspeak<span data-line="104"></span>*<span data-line="104"></span> — was
        startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an
        enormous pyramidal  structure  of  glittering  white  concrete,
        soaring  up,  terrace  after  terrace, 300 metres into the air.
        From where Winston stood it was just possible to  read,  picked
        out  on  its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans
        of the Party:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="112" style="display:block"><code>         WAR IS PEACE
         FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
         IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="116"><span data-line="116"></span>The Ministry  of  Truth  contained,  it  was  said,  three
        thousand   rooms   above   ground   level,   and  corresponding
        ramifications below. Scattered about  London  there  were  just
        three  other  buildings  of  similar  appearance  and  size. So
        completely did they dwarf  the  surrounding  architecture  that
        from  the  roof  of  Victory Mansions you could see all four of
        them simultaneously. They were the homes of the four Ministries
        between which the entire apparatus of government  was  divided.
        The  Ministry  of  Truth,  which  concerned  itself  with news,
        entertainment, education, and the fine arts.  The  Ministry  of
        Peace,  which  concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love,
        which maintained law and order. And  the  Ministry  of  Plenty,
        which  was  responsible  for  economic affairs. Their names, in
        Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="131"><span data-line="131"></span>The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There
        were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been inside the
        Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it. It  was  a
        place impossible to enter except on official business, and then
        only   by   penetrating   through   a   maze   of   barbed-wire
        entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests.  Even
        the  streets  leading  up  to its outer barriers were roamed by
        gorilla-faced guards in  black  uniforms,  armed  with  jointed
        truncheons.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="141"><span data-line="141"></span>Winston  turned  round  abruptly.  He had set his features
        into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to
        wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room  into  the
        tiny  kitchen.  By  leaving the Ministry at this time of day he
        had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware  that
        there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured
        bread  which  had  got to be saved for tomorrow<span data-line="147"></span>&#39;<span data-line="147"></span>s breakfast. He
        took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid  with  a
        plain  white  label  marked  VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly,
        oily smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly
        a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock,  and  gulped  it  down
        like a dose of medicine.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="154"><span data-line="154"></span>Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of
        his eyes.  The  stuff  was  like  nitric acid, and moreover, in
        swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of
        the head with a rubber club.  The  next  moment,  however,  the
        burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more
        cheerful.  He  took  a  cigarette from a crumpled packet marked
        VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright,  whereupon
        the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more
        successful.  He  went back to the living-room and sat down at a
        small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From  the
        table  drawer  he  took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a
        thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back  and  a  marbled
        cover.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="168"><span data-line="168"></span>For  some  reason the telescreen in the living-room was in
        an unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in
        the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was  in
        the  longer  wall, opposite the window. To one side of it there
        was a shallow alcove in which  Winston  was  now  sitting,  and
        which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to
        hold  bookshelves.  By  sitting in the alcove, and keeping well
        back, Winston was able to  remain  outside  the  range  of  the
        telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course,
        but  so  long as he stayed in his present position he could not
        be seen. It was partly the unusual geography of the  room  that
        had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="181"><span data-line="181"></span>But  it  had  also  been suggested by the book that he had
        just taken out of the drawer. It  was  a  peculiarly  beautiful
        book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of
        a  kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years
        past. He could guess, however, that the  book  was  much  older
        than  that.  He  had  seen  it  lying in the window of a frowsy
        little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of  the  town  (just  what
        quarter  he  did  not  now  remember)  and  had  been  stricken
        immediately by an overwhelming  desire  to  possess  it.  Party
        members  were  supposed not to go into ordinary shops (<span data-line="190"></span>&#8216;dealing
        on the free market&#8217;<span data-line="191"></span>, it was  called),  but  the  rule  was  not
        strictly  kept,  because  there  were  various  things, such as
        shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold
        of in any other way. He had given a quick glance  up  and  down
        the  street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for
        two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of  wanting
        it  for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home
        in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in  it,  it  was  a
        compromising possession.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="201"><span data-line="201"></span>The  thing  that  he  was about to do was to open a diary.
        This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were  no
        longer  any  laws),  but  if detected it was reasonably certain
        that it would be punished by death, or at least by  twenty-five
        years  in  a  forced-labour  camp. Winston fitted a nib into the
        penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen  was  an
        archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had
        procured  one,  furtively  and  with  some  difficulty,  simply
        because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy  paper  deserved
        to  be  written  on  with a real nib instead of being scratched
        with an ink-pencil. Actually he was  not  used  to  writing  by
        hand.  Apart  from  very  short  notes, it was usual to dictate
        everything into the speak-write which was of  course  impossible
        for  his  present  purpose.  He dipped the pen into the ink and
        then faltered for just a second. A tremor had gone through  his
        bowels. To mark the paper was the decisive act. In small clumsy
        letters he wrote:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="219" style="display:block"><code>         April 4th, 1984.</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="221"><span data-line="221"></span>He   sat  back.  A  sense  of  complete  helplessness  had
        descended upon him. To begin with, he did  not  know  with  any
        certainty that this was 1984. It must be round about that date,
        since  he  was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he
        believed that he had been born in 1944  or  1945;  but  it  was
        never  possible  nowadays to pin down any date within a year or
        two.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="229"><span data-line="229"></span>For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to  wonder,  was  he
        writing  this  diary?  For the future, for the unborn. His mind
        hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the  page,  and
        then   fetched  up  with  a  bump  against  the  Newspeak  word
        doublethink. For the first time the magnitude of what he
        had undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with
        the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the  future
        would  resemble  the present, in which case it would not listen
        to him: or it would be different from it, and  his  predicament
        would be meaningless.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="240"><span data-line="240"></span>For  some  time  he  sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The
        telescreen had changed over to strident military music. It  was
        curious  that  he  seemed  not merely to have lost the power of
        expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that
        he had originally intended to say. For weeks past he  had  been
        making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind
        that  anything  would  be  needed  except  courage.  The actual
        writing would be easy. All he had to  do  was  to  transfer  to
        paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running
        inside  his head, literally for years. At this moment, however,
        even the monologue had dried up. Moreover  his  varicose  ulcer
        had  begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it, because
        if he did so  it  always  became  inflamed.  The  seconds  were
        ticking by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of
        the  page  in  front  of him, the itching of the skin above his
        ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness  caused
        by the gin.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="258"><span data-line="258"></span>Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly
        aware  of  what  he  was  setting  down. His small but childish
        handwriting straggled up and down the page, shedding first  its
        capital letters and finally even its full stops:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="263"><span data-line="263"></span>April  4th,  1984.  Last  night  to the flicks. All war
        films. One very good one of  a  ship  full  of  refugees  being
        bombed  somewhere in the Mediterranean. Audience much amused by
        shots of a great huge fat  man  trying  to  swim  away  with  a
        helicopter  after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the
        water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters
        gunsights, then he was full of holes  and  the  sea  round  him
        turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let
        in  the  water,  audience  shouting with laughter when he sank.
        then you saw a lifeboat full  of  children  with  a  helicopter
        hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman might have been
        a  jewess  sitting  up in the bow with a little boy about three
        years old in her arms. little boy  screaming  with  fright  and
        hiding  his  head  between  her  breasts as if he was trying to
        burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round  him
        and  comforting  him although she was blue with fright herself,
        all the time covering him up as much  as  possible  as  if  she
        thought  her  arms  could  keep  the  bullets off him. then the
        helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific  flash
        and  the boat went all to matchwood. then there was a wonderful
        shot of a child<span data-line="283"></span>&#39;<span data-line="283"></span>s arm going up up up right up into  the  air  a
        helicopter  with  a camera in its nose must have followed it up
        and there was a lot of applause from  the  party  seats  but  a
        woman  down  in  the  prole  part of the house suddenly started
        kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed  it
        not  in  front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of
        kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i  dont
        suppose  anything  happened to her nobody cares what the proles
        say typical prole reaction they never
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="293"><span data-line="293"></span>Winston stopped writing, partly because he  was  suffering
        from  cramp.  He  did  not know what had made him pour out this
        stream of rubbish. But the curious thing was that while he  was
        doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his
        mind,  to  the  point  where he almost felt equal to writing it
        down. It was, he now realized, because of this  other  incident
        that  he  had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary
        today.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="302"><span data-line="302"></span>It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if  anything
        so nebulous could be said to happen.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="305"><span data-line="305"></span>It   was   nearly  eleven  hundred,  and  in  the  Records
        Department, where Winston worked, they were dragging the chairs
        out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall
        opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes
        Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one  of  the  middle
        rows  when  two  people  whom  he  knew by sight, but had never
        spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them  was  a
        girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not know her
        name,  but  he  knew that she worked in the Fiction Department.
        Presumably — since he had sometimes seen her with  oily  hands
        and  carrying  a  spanner she had some mechanical job on one of
        the novel-writing machines. She was  a  bold-looking  girl,  of
        about  twenty-seven,  with  thick  hair, a freckled face, and
        swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the
        Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist
        of  her  overalls,  just  tightly  enough  to  bring  out   the
        shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very
        first  moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because
        of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community
        hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to  carry
        about  with  her.  He disliked nearly all women, and especially
        the young and pretty ones. It was always the women,  and  above
        all  the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the
        Party,  the  swallowers  of  slogans,  the  amateur  spies  and
        nosers-out  of  unorthodoxy.  But this particular girl gave him
        the impression of being more dangerous  than  most.  Once  when
        they  passed  in  the  corridor  she  gave him a quick sidelong
        glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for  a  moment
        had filled him with black terror. The idea had even crossed his
        mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, it
        was  true,  was  very  unlikely.  Still, he continued to feel a
        peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as  well  as
        hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="339"><span data-line="339"></span>The  other person was a man named O<span data-line="339"></span>&#39;<span data-line="339"></span>Brien, a member of the
        Inner Party and holder of some post  so  important  and  remote
        that  Winston  had  only  a dim idea of its nature. A momentary
        hush passed over the group of people round the chairs  as  they
        saw  the  black  overalls of an Inner Party member approaching.
        O<span data-line="344"></span>&#39;<span data-line="344"></span>Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a  coarse,
        humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he
        had a certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his
        spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming — in some
        indefinable  way,  curiously civilized. It was a gesture which,
        if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have  recalled
        an  eighteenth-century  nobleman offering his snuffbox. Winston
        had seen O<span data-line="351"></span>&#39;<span data-line="351"></span>Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years.
        He felt deeply drawn to him, and  not  solely  because  he  was
        intrigued  by  the contrast between O<span data-line="353"></span>&#39;<span data-line="353"></span>Brien<span data-line="353"></span>&#39;<span data-line="353"></span>s urbane manner and
        his prize-fighter<span data-line="354"></span>&#39;<span data-line="354"></span>s physique. Much more it  was  because  of  a
        secretly  held belief — or perhaps not even a belief, merely a
        hope — that O<span data-line="356"></span>&#39;<span data-line="356"></span>Brien<span data-line="356"></span>&#39;<span data-line="356"></span>s political  orthodoxy  was  not  perfect.
        Something  in  his  face  suggested it irresistibly. And again,
        perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that  was  written  in  his
        face,  but  simply  intelligence.  But  at  any rate he had the
        appearance of being a person that you could talk to if  somehow
        you  could  cheat the telescreen and get him alone. Winston had
        never made the smallest effort to verify  this  guess:  indeed,
        there was no way of doing so. At this moment O<span data-line="363"></span>&#39;<span data-line="363"></span>Brien glanced at
        his  wrist-watch,  saw  that  it was nearly eleven hundred, and
        evidently decided to stay in the Records Department  until  the
        Two  Minutes  Hate was over. He took a chair in the same row as
        Winston, a couple of places away. A small,  sandy-haired  woman
        who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them. The
        girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="371"><span data-line="371"></span>The  next  moment  a  hideous, grinding speech, as of some
        monstrous machine running  without  oil,  burst  from  the  big
        telescreen  at  the  end  of  the room. It was a noise that set
        one<span data-line="374"></span>&#39;<span data-line="374"></span>s teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of  one<span data-line="374"></span>&#39;<span data-line="374"></span>s
        neck. The Hate had started.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="377"><span data-line="377"></span>As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the
        People,  had  flashed  on to the screen. There were hisses here
        and there among the audience.  The  little  sandy-haired  woman
        gave  a  squeak  of mingled fear and disgust. Goldstein was the
        renegade and backslider who  once,  long  ago  (how  long  ago,
        nobody  quite  remembered), had been one of the leading figures
        of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother  himself,  and
        then  had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been
        condemned  to  death,  and   had   mysteriously   escaped   and
        disappeared. The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from
        day  to  day, but there was none in which Goldstein was not the
        principal figure. He  was  the  primal  traitor,  the  earliest
        defiler  of  the  Party<span data-line="389"></span>&#39;<span data-line="389"></span>s purity. All subsequent crimes against
        the  Party,  all  treacheries,  acts  of  sabotage,   heresies,
        deviations,  sprang  directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or
        other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps
        somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of  his  foreign
        paymasters,  perhaps even — so it was occasionally rumoured —
        in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="397"><span data-line="397"></span>Winston<span data-line="397"></span>&#39;<span data-line="397"></span>s diaphragm was constricted. He  could  never  see
        the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It
        was  a  lean  Jewish  face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white
        hair and a small goatee beard — a clever face, and yet somehow
        inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness  in  the
        long  thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was
        perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice,  too,
        had  a  sheep-like  quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual
        venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party — an attack so
        exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able  to
        see  through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with
        an alarmed feeling that other people,  less  level-headed  than
        oneself,  might  be taken in by it. He was abusing Big Brother,
        he was  denouncing  the  dictatorship  of  the  Party,  he  was
        demanding  the  immediate  conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he
        was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom
        of assembly, freedom of thought,  he  was  crying  hysterically
        that  the revolution had been betrayed — and all this in rapid
        polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the  habitual
        style  of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak
        words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would
        normally use in real life. And all the while, lest  one  should
        be  in  any  doubt as to the reality which Goldstein<span data-line="419"></span>&#39;<span data-line="419"></span>s specious
        claptrap covered, behind  his  head  on  the  telescreen  there
        marched  the  endless columns of the Eurasian army — row after
        row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who
        swam up to the surface  of  the  screen  and  vanished,  to  be
        replaced  by others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of
        the  soldiers<span data-line="425"></span>_<span data-line="425"></span>&#39;<span data-line="425"></span>  boots  formed  the  background  to  Goldstein<span data-line="425"></span>&#39;<span data-line="425"></span>s
        bleating voice.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="428"><span data-line="428"></span>Before   the   Hate  had  proceeded  for  thirty  seconds,
        uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half
        the people in the room. The self-satisfied sheep-like  face  on
        the  screen,  and  the  terrifying  power  of the Eurasian army
        behind it, were too much to be borne:  besides,  the  sight  or
        even   the   thought  of  Goldstein  produced  fear  and  anger
        automatically. He was an object of hatred  more  constant  than
        either  Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with
        one of these Powers it was generally at peace with  the  other.
        But  what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and
        despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand  times
        a  day,  on  platforms,  on  the  telescreen, in newspapers, in
        books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed,  held  up
        to  the  general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in
        spite of all this, his influence never  seemed  to  grow  less.
        Always  there  were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him. A
        day never passed when spies  and  saboteurs  acting  under  his
        directions  were not unmasked by the Thought Police. He was the
        commander of a vast shadowy army,  an  underground  network  of
        conspirators  dedicated  to  the  overthrow  of  the State. The
        Brotherhood, its name was  supposed  to  be.  There  were  also
        whispered  stories  of a terrible book, a compendium of all the
        heresies,  of  which  Goldstein  was  the  author   and   which
        circulated  clandestinely here and there. It was a book without
        a title. People referred to it, if at  all,  simply  as  the
        book.  But  one  knew  of  such  things  only through vague
        rumours. Neither the Brotherhood  nor  the  book  was  a
        subject  that  any ordinary Party member would mention if there
        was a way of avoiding it.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="458"><span data-line="458"></span>In its second minute the Hate rose  to  a  frenzy.  People
        were  leaping  up  and down in their places and shouting at the
        tops of their voices  in  an  effort  to  drown  the  maddening
        bleating  voice  that  came  from the screen. The little 
        sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was  opening
        and  shutting  like that of a landed fish. Even O<span data-line="463"></span>&#8216;Brien&#39;s heavy
        face was flushed. He was sitting very straight  in  his  chair,
        his  powerful  chest  swelling  and quivering as though he were
        standing up to the assault of  a  wave.  The  dark-haired  girl
        behind  Winston had begun crying out &#8217;<span data-line="467"></span><em class="em-low1">Swine! Swine! Swine!</em><span data-line="467"></span>&#39;<span data-line="467"></span> and
        suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it
        at the screen. It struck Goldstein<span data-line="469"></span>&#39;<span data-line="469"></span>s nose and bounced off;  the
        voice  continued  inexorably.  In  a lucid moment Winston found
        that he was shouting with  the  others  and  kicking  his  heel
        violently  against  the  rung  of his chair. The horrible thing
        about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to  act
        a  part,  but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid
        joining in. Within  thirty  seconds  any  pretence  was  always
        unnecessary.  A  hideous  ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a
        desire  to  kill,  to  torture,  to  smash  faces  in  with   a
        sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people
        like  an  electric current, turning one even against one<span data-line="479"></span>&#39;<span data-line="479"></span>s will
        into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that  one
        felt  was  an  abstract,  undirected  emotion  which  could  be
        switched from one  object  to  another  like  the  flame  of  a
        blowlamp.  Thus,  at one moment Winston<span data-line="483"></span>&#39;<span data-line="483"></span>s hatred was not turned
        against Goldstein at all, but, on  the  contrary,  against  Big
        Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments
        his  heart  went  out  to  the  lonely,  derided heretic on the
        screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world  of  lies.
        And  yet  the  very  next instant he was at one with the people
        about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him  to
        be  true.  At  those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother
        changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up,  an
        invincible,  fearless  protector,  standing like a rock against
        the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of  his  isolation,
        his  helplessness,  and  the  doubt  that  hung  about his very
        existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by  the
        mere   power   of  his  voice  of  wrecking  the  structure  of
        civilization.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="499"><span data-line="499"></span>It was even possible, at moments, to switch  one<span data-line="499"></span>&#39;<span data-line="499"></span>s  hatred
        this  way  or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of
        violent effort with which one wrenches one<span data-line="501"></span>&#39;<span data-line="501"></span>s head away from the
        pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded  in  transferring  his
        hatred  from  the  face  on  the screen to the dark-haired girl
        behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his
        mind. He would flog her to death with a  rubber  truncheon.  He
        would  tie  her  naked  to a stake and shoot her full of arrows
        like Saint Sebastian. He would ravish her and cut her throat at
        the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized
        why it was that he hated her. He  hated  her  because  she  was
        young  and  pretty  and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed
        with her and would never do so, because round her sweet  supple
        waist,  which  seemed  to ask you to encircle it with your arm,
        there was only the odious scarlet sash,  aggressive  symbol  of
        chastity.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="516"><span data-line="516"></span>The  Hate  rose  to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had
        become an actual sheep<span data-line="517"></span>&#39;<span data-line="517"></span>s bleat, and for  an  instant  the  face
        changed  into  that of a sheep. Then the sheep-face melted into
        the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed  to  be  advancing,
        huge  and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming to
        spring out of the surface of the screen, so that  some  of  the
        people  in  the  front row actually flinched backwards in their
        seats. But in the same moment, drawing a deep  sigh  of  relief
        from  everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big
        Brother, black-haired, black-moustachio<span data-line="525"></span>&#39;<span data-line="525"></span>d,  full  of  power  and
        mysterious  calm,  and  so  vast  that  it almost filled up the
        screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying. It was merely
        a few words of  encouragement,  the  sort  of  words  that  are
        uttered  in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually
        but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then  the
        face  of  Big  Brother  faded away again, and instead the three
        slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="534" style="display:block"><code>         WAR IS PEACE
         FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
         IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="538"><span data-line="538"></span>But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for  several
        seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on
        everyone<span data-line="540"></span>&#39;<span data-line="540"></span>s  eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately. The
        little sandy-haired woman had flung  herself  forward  over  the
        back of the chair in front of her. With a tremulous murmur that
        sounded  like  <span data-line="543"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">My  Saviour!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="543"></span> she extended her arms towards the
        screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was  apparent
        that she was uttering a prayer.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="547"><span data-line="547"></span>At  this  moment  the  entire group of people broke into a
        deep, slow, rhythmical chant of <span data-line="548"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">B-B! … B-B!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="548"></span> —  over  and
        over  again,  very  slowly, with a long pause between the first
        <span data-line="550"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">B</em>&#8217;<span data-line="550"></span> and the second-a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow  curiously
        savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp
        of  naked  feet  and  the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as
        much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a  refrain  that
        was  often  heard in moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it
        was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty  of  Big  Brother,
        but  still  more  it  was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate
        drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise. Winston<span data-line="557"></span>&#39;<span data-line="557"></span>s
        entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he  could
        not  help  sharing  in the general delirium, but this sub-human
        chanting of <span data-line="560"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">B-B! … B-B!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="560"></span> always filled him with  horror.
        Of  course  he  chanted  with the rest: it was impossible to do
        otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to
        do what everyone else was doing, was an  instinctive  reaction.
        But  there  was a space of a couple of seconds during which the
        expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And
        it was exactly  at  this  moment  that  the  significant  thing
        happened — if, indeed, it did happen.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="569"><span data-line="569"></span>Momentarily he caught O<span data-line="569"></span>&#8216;Brien&#39;s eye. O&#39;Brien had stood up.
        He had  taken  off  his  spectacles  and  was  in  the  act  of
        resettling them on his nose with  his  characteristic  gesture.
        But  there  was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and
        for  as  long  as  it  took  to  happen  Winston  knew — yes,  he
        knew! — that  O&#39;Brien  was  thinking  the  same thing as
        himself. An unmistakable message had passed. It was  as  though
        their  two  minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from
        one into the other through their eyes. &#8217;<span data-line="577"></span><em class="em-low1">I am with you,</em><span data-line="577"></span>&#39;<span data-line="577"></span> O<span data-line="577"></span>&#8216;Brien
        seemed to be saying to him. &#8217;<span data-line="578"></span><em class="em-low1">I  know  precisely  what  you  are
        feeling.  I  know  all  about  your contempt, your hatred, your
        disgust. But don&#39;t worry, I am on  your  side!</em><span data-line="580"></span>&#39;<span data-line="580"></span>  And  then  the
        flash  of  intelligence  was  gone,  and  O<span data-line="581"></span>&#39;<span data-line="581"></span>Brien<span data-line="581"></span>&#39;<span data-line="581"></span>s face was as
        inscrutable as everybody else<span data-line="582"></span>&#39;<span data-line="582"></span>s.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="584"><span data-line="584"></span>That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it  had
        happened.  Such  incidents  never had any sequel. All that they
        did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope,  that  others
        besides  himself  were  the  enemies  of the Party. Perhaps the
        rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all —
        perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible,  in
        spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to
        be  sure  that the Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days
        he believed in it, some days not. There was no  evidence,  only
        fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches
        of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls —
        once,  even,  when  two  strangers met, a small movement of the
        hand which had looked  as  though  it  might  be  a  signal  of
        recognition.  It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined
        everything. He had gone back to his cubicle without looking  at
        O<span data-line="599"></span>&#39;<span data-line="599"></span>Brien again. The idea of following up their momentary contact
        hardly  crossed  his  mind.  It  would  have been inconceivably
        dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a
        second, two seconds, they had exchanged  an  equivocal  glance,
        and  that  was  the  end  of  the  story.  But  even that was a
        memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which one  had  to
        live.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="607"><span data-line="607"></span>Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a
        belch. The gin was rising from his stomach.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="610"><span data-line="610"></span>His  eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that while
        he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by
        automatic action. And  it  was  no  longer  the  same  cramped,
        awkward  handwriting  as  before. His pen had slid voluptuously
        over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="616" style="display:block"><code>         DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER

<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="622"><span data-line="622"></span>over and over again, filling half a page.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="624"><span data-line="624"></span>He could not help  feeling  a  twinge  of  panic.  It  was
        absurd,  since  the  writing  of those particular words was not
        more dangerous than the initial act of opening the  diary,  but
        for  a  moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and
        abandon the enterprise altogether.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="630"><span data-line="630"></span>He did not do so, however, because he  knew  that  it  was
        useless.  Whether he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he
        refrained from writing it, made no difference. Whether he  went
        on with the diary, or whether he did not go on with it, made no
        difference.  The Thought Police would get him just the same. He
        had committed — would still have committed,  even  if  he  had
        never  set  pen  to paper — the essential crime that contained
        all  others  in   itself.   Thoughtcrime,   they   called   it.
        Thoughtcrime  was not a thing that could be concealed for ever.
        You might dodge successfully for a while, even for  years,  but
        sooner or later they were bound to get you.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="642"><span data-line="642"></span>It  was always at night — the arrests invariably happened
        at night. The sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand  shaking
        your  shoulder,  the  lights  glaring in your eyes, the ring of
        hard faces round the bed. In the vast majority of  cases  there
        was   no   trial,  no  report  of  the  arrest.  People  simply
        disappeared, always during the night.  Your  name  was  removed
        from  the  registers,  every  record of everything you had ever
        done was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied and then
        forgotten. You were  abolished,  annihilated:  vaporized
        was the usual word.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="653"><span data-line="653"></span>For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began
        writing in a hurried untidy scrawl:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="656"><span data-line="656"></span>theyll  shoot  me  i  don<span data-line="656"></span>&#39;<span data-line="656"></span>t care theyll shoot me in the
        back of the neck i dont care down with big brother they  always
        shoot  you  in  the  back of the neck i dont care down with big
        brother
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="661"><span data-line="661"></span>He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and
        laid down the pen. The next moment he started violently.  There
        was a knocking at the door.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="665"><span data-line="665"></span>Already!  He  sat  as still as a mouse, in the futile hope
        that whoever it was might go away after a single  attempt.  But
        no,  the knocking was repeated. The worst thing of all would be
        to delay. His heart was thumping like a  drum,  but  his  face,
        from  long  habit,  was  probably expressionless. He got up and
        moved heavily towards the door.
</p><h2 id="sec--" class="h1" data-line="672" data-heading-depth="1" style="display:block"><span data-line="672"></span><span class="heading-before"><span class="heading-label">2</span>.&#8194;</span><span data-line="672"></span> </h2>
<p class="p noindent" data-line="674"><span data-line="674"></span>As he put his hand to the door-knob Winston  saw  that  he
        had left the diary open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was
        written all over it, in letters almost big enough to be legible
        across  the  room. It was an inconceivably stupid thing to have
        done. But, he realized, even in his panic he had not wanted  to
        smudge  the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was
        wet.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="682"><span data-line="682"></span>He drew in his breath and opened  the  door.  Instantly  a
        warm   wave   of  relief  flowed  through  him.  A  colourless,
        crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair and a  lined  face,  was
        standing outside.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="687"><span data-line="687"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oh,  comrade,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="687"></span>  she  began  in  a dreary, whining sort of
        voice, <span data-line="688"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I thought I heard you come in. Do you think  you  could
        come  across  and  have  a  look  at our kitchen sink? It&#39;s got
        blocked up and-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="690"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="692"><span data-line="692"></span>It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour  on  the  same
        floor.  (<span data-line="693"></span>&#8216;Mrs_&#8217;<span data-line="693"></span> was a word somewhat discountenanced by the Party
        — you were supposed to call everyone  <span data-line="694"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">comrade</em>&#8217;<span data-line="694"></span>  —  but  with
        some women one used it instinctively.) She was a woman of about
        thirty,  but  looking  much  older. One had the impression that
        there was dust in the creases of her face. Winston followed her
        down the passage. These amateur  repair  jobs  were  an  almost
        daily  irritation.  Victory  Mansions  were old flats, built in
        1930 or thereabouts, and were falling to  pieces.  The  plaster
        flaked  constantly  from ceilings and walls, the pipes burst in
        every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was snow,  the
        heating  system  was  usually running at half steam when it was
        not closed down altogether from motives  of  economy.  Repairs,
        except  what you could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by
        remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending
        of a window-pane for two years.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="709"><span data-line="709"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Of course it&#39;s only because Tom  isn&#39;t  home,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="709"></span>  said  Mrs
        Parsons vaguely.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="712"><span data-line="712"></span>The  Parsons<span data-line="712"></span>_<span data-line="712"></span>&#39;<span data-line="712"></span> flat was bigger than Winston<span data-line="712"></span>&#39;<span data-line="712"></span>s, and dingy in
        a different way. Everything had a battered,  trampled-on  look,
        as though the place had just been visited by some large violent
        animal.  Games  impedimenta  — hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves. a
        burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned  inside  out  —
        lay  all over the floor, and on the table there was a litter of
        dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books. On  the  walls  were
        scarlet  banners  of  the  Youth  League  and  the Spies, and a
        full-sized  poster  of  Big  Brother.  There  was   the   usual
        boiled-cabbage  smell, common to the whole building, but it was
        shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which-one knew this at
        the first sniff, though it was hard to say how was the sweat of
        some person not present at the moment. In another room  someone
        with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune
        with  the  military  music  which  was  still  issuing from the
        telescreen.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="729"><span data-line="729"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s the children,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="729"></span> said Mrs  Parsons,  casting  a<span data-line="729"></span><br>
<span data-line="730"></span>        half-apprehensive  glance at the door. <span data-line="730"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They haven&#39;t been out today.
        And of course-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="731"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="733"><span data-line="733"></span>She had a habit of  breaking  off  her  sentences  in  the
        middle.  The  kitchen  sink  was  full  nearly to the brim with
        filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever  of  cabbage.
        Winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe. He
        hated  using  his  hands,  and he hated bending down, which was
        always liable to start him  coughing.  Mrs  Parsons  looked  on
        helplessly.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="741"><span data-line="741"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Of course if Tom was home he&#39;d put it right in a moment,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="741"></span>
        she said.  <span data-line="742"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">He loves anything like that. He&#39;s ever so good with
        his hands, Tom is.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="743"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="745"><span data-line="745"></span>Parsons was Winston<span data-line="745"></span>&#39;<span data-line="745"></span>s fellow-employee at the  Ministry  of
        Truth. He was a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity,
        a  mass  of  imbecile  enthusiasms  —  one of those completely
        unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than  on  the
        Thought  Police,  the  stability  of  the  Party  depended.  At
        thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the Youth
        League, and before graduating into  the  Youth  League  he  had
        managed to stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory
        age.  At  the Ministry he was employed in some subordinate post
        for which intelligence was not required, but on the other  hand
        he  was  a  leading  figure on the Sports Committee and all the
        other  committees  engaged  in  organizing   community   hikes,
        spontaneous  demonstrations,  savings  campaigns, and voluntary
        activities generally. He would inform  you  with  quiet  pride,
        between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at
        the  Community Centre every evening for the past four years. An
        overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testimony to
        the strenuousness of his life, followed him about  wherever  he
        went, and even remained behind him after he had gone.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="765"><span data-line="765"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Have  you  got a spanner?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="765"></span> said Winston, fiddling with the
        nut on the angle-joint.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="768"><span data-line="768"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">A  spanner,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="768"></span>  said  Mrs  Parsons,  immediately   becoming
        invertebrate. <span data-line="769"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m sure. Perhaps the children -</em>&#8217;<span data-line="769"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="771"><span data-line="771"></span>There  was  a  trampling of boots and another blast on the
        comb as the children charged into the living-room. Mrs  Parsons
        brought  the spanner. Winston let out the water and disgustedly
        removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe. He
        cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the
        tap and went back into the other room.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="778"><span data-line="778"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Up with your hands!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="778"></span> yelled a savage voice.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="780"><span data-line="780"></span>A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped  up  from
        behind  the  table  and  was  menacing him with a toy automatic
        pistol, while his small sister, about two years  younger,  made
        the  same  gesture  with  a fragment of wood. Both of them were
        dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and  red  neckerchiefs
        which  were  the uniform of the Spies. Winston raised his hands
        above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was  the
        boy<span data-line="787"></span>&#39;<span data-line="787"></span>s demeanour, that it was not altogether a game.
</p>

        You&#39;re a Eurasian spy! I&#39;ll shoot you, I&#39;ll  vaporize
        you, I&#39;ll send you to the salt mines!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="791"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="793"><span data-line="793"></span>Suddenly  they  were  both  leaping  round  him,  shouting
        <span data-line="794"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Traitor!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="794"></span> and <span data-line="794"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Thought-criminal!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="794"></span> the  little  girl  imitating
        her   brother  in  every  movement.  It  was  somehow  slightly
        frightening, like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will  soon
        grow  up  into  man-eaters.  There  was  a  sort of calculating
        ferocity in the boy<span data-line="798"></span>&#39;<span data-line="798"></span>s eye, a quite evident  desire  to  hit  or
        kick  Winston  and  a  consciousness  of  being very nearly big
        enough to do so. It was a good job it was not a real pistol  he
        was holding, Winston thought.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="803"><span data-line="803"></span>Mrs  Parsons<span data-line="803"></span>_<span data-line="803"></span>&#39;<span data-line="803"></span>  eyes  flitted nervously from Winston to the
        children,  and  back  again.  In  the  better  light   of   the
        living-room  he  noticed  with  interest  that  there  actually
        was dust in the creases of her face.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="808"><span data-line="808"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They do get so noisy,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="808"></span> she  said.  <span data-line="808"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They&#39;re  disappointed
        because they couldn&#39;t go to see the hanging, that&#39;s what it is.
        I&#39;m  too  busy to take them. and Tom won&#39;t be back from work in
        time.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="811"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="813"><span data-line="813"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Why can&#39;t we go and see the hanging?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="813"></span> roared the  boy  in
        his huge voice.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="816"><span data-line="816"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Want  to  see  the  hanging!  Want to see the hanging!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="816"></span>
        chanted the little girl, still capering round.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="819"><span data-line="819"></span>Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to  be
        hanged  in  the  Park  that  evening,  Winston remembered. This
        happened about once a  month,  and  was  a  popular  spectacle.
        Children  always  clamoured  to be taken to see it. He took his
        leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But he had not gone
        six steps down the passage when something hit the back  of  his
        neck  an  agonizingly  painful blow. It was as though a red-hot
        wire had been jabbed into him. He spun round just  in  time  to
        see  Mrs  Parsons  dragging her son back into the doorway while
        the boy pocketed a catapult.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="830"><span data-line="830"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Goldstein!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="830"></span> bellowed the boy as the door closed  on  him.
        But what most struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on
        the woman<span data-line="832"></span>&#39;<span data-line="832"></span>s greyish face.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="834"><span data-line="834"></span>Back  in  the  flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen
        and sat down at the table again, still rubbing  his  neck.  The
        music  from  the  telescreen  had  stopped.  Instead, a clipped
        military voice was reading out, with a sort of brutal relish, a
        description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress which
        had just been anchored between lceland and the Faroe lslands.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="841"><span data-line="841"></span>With those children, he thought, that wretched woman  must
        lead  a life of terror. Another year, two years, and they would
        be watching her night and  day  for  symptoms  of  unorthodoxy.
        Nearly  all  children nowadays were horrible. What was worst of
        all was that by means of such organizations as the  Spies  they
        were  systematically  turned  into ungovernable little savages,
        and yet this produced in them no  tendency  whatever  to  rebel
        against  the  discipline  of  the  Party. On the contrary, they
        adored the Party and everything connected with it.  The  songs,
        the  processions,  the  banners,  the hiking, the drilling with
        dummy rifles, the  yelling  of  slogans,  the  worship  of  Big
        Brother  —  it  was  all  a sort of glorious game to them. All
        their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of  the
        State,     against     foreigners,     traitors,     saboteurs,
        thought-criminals. It was almost normal for people over  thirty
        to  be  frightened of their own children. And with good reason,
        for hardly a week passed in  which  The  Times  did  not
        carry  a  paragraph  describing  how  some eavesdropping little
        sneak — <span data-line="859"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">child hero</em>&#8217;<span data-line="859"></span> was the  phrase  generally  used  —  had
        overheard some compromising remark and denounced its parents to
        the Thought Police.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="863"><span data-line="863"></span>The  sting  of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked
        up his pen half-heartedly,  wondering  whether  he  could  find
        something  more  to  write  in  the  diary.  Suddenly  he began
        thinking of O<span data-line="866"></span>&#39;<span data-line="866"></span>Brien again.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="868"><span data-line="868"></span>Years ago — how long was it? Seven years it must be — he
        had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark room.  And
        someone  sitting  to one side of him had said as he passed: <span data-line="870"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We
        shall meet in the place where there is  no  darkness.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="871"></span>  It  was
        said  very  quietly,  almost  casually  —  a  statement, not a
        command. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was
        that at the time, in the dream, the words  had  not  made  much
        impression  on  him. It was only later and by degrees that they
        had seemed to take on significance. He could not  now  remember
        whether  it  was  before  or after having the dream that he had
        seen O<span data-line="878"></span>&#39;<span data-line="878"></span>Brien for the first time, nor could he remember when  he
        had  first  identified  the voice as O<span data-line="879"></span>&#39;<span data-line="879"></span>Brien<span data-line="879"></span>&#39;<span data-line="879"></span>s. But at any rate
        the identification existed. It was O<span data-line="880"></span>&#39;<span data-line="880"></span>Brien who  had  spoken  to
        him out of the dark.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="883"><span data-line="883"></span>Winston  had  never  been  able to feel sure — even after
        this morning<span data-line="884"></span>&#39;<span data-line="884"></span>s flash of the eyes it was still impossible to  be
        sure  whether O<span data-line="885"></span>&#8216;Brien was a friend or an enemy. Nor did it even
        seem to matter greatly.  There  was  a  link  of  understanding
        between  them,  more  important than affection or partisanship.
        &#8217;<span data-line="888"></span><em class="em-low1">We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,</em><span data-line="888"></span>&#39;<span data-line="888"></span> he had
        said. Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way
        or another it would come true.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="892"><span data-line="892"></span>The voice from the  telescreen  paused.  A  trumpet  call,
        clear  and  beautiful, floated into the stagnant air. The voice
        continued raspingly:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="896"><span data-line="896"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has  this
        moment  arrived  from  the  Malabar  front. Our forces in South
        India have won a glorious victory. I am authorized to say  that
        the  action  we are now reporting may well bring the war within
        measurable distance of its end. Here is the newsflash -</em>&#8217;<span data-line="900"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="902"><span data-line="902"></span>Bad  news  coming,  thought  Winston.  And  sure   enough,
        following  on  a  gory  description  of  the  annihilation of a
        Eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners,
        came the announcement that, as from next  week,  the  chocolate
        ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="908"><span data-line="908"></span>Winston  belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving a
        deflated feeling. The telescreen — perhaps  to  celebrate  the
        victory,  perhaps  to drown the memory of the lost chocolate —
        crashed into <span data-line="911"></span>&#8216;_Oceania, &#8217;<span data-line="911"></span>_<span data-line="911"></span>tis for thee<span data-line="911"></span>&#39;<span data-line="911"></span>.  You  were  supposed  to
        stand  to  attention.  However,  in his present position he was
        invisible.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="915"><span data-line="915"></span>&#8216;_Oceania, &#8217;<span data-line="915"></span><em class="em-low1">tis  for  thee</em><span data-line="915"></span>&#39;<span data-line="915"></span>  gave  way  to  lighter  music.
        Winston  walked  over  to  the  window, keeping his back to the
        telescreen. The day was still cold  and  clear.  Somewhere  far
        away  a  rocket  bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating roar.
        About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London at
        present.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="922"><span data-line="922"></span>Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and
        fro, and  the  word  INGSOC  fitfully  appeared  and  vanished.
        Ingsoc. The sacred principles of Ingsoc. Newspeak, doublethink,
        the mutability of the past. He felt as though he were wandering
        in  the  forests  of  the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world
        where he himself was the monster. He was alone.  The  past  was
        dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty had he that a
        single  human creature now living was on his side? And what way
        of knowing that the dominion of  the  Party  would  not  endure
        for ever? Like an answer, the three slogans on the white
        face of the Ministry of Truth came back to him:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="934" style="display:block"><code>         WAR IS PEACE
         FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
         IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
         </code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="939"><span data-line="939"></span>He took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket. There,
        too, in  tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed,
        and on the other face of the coin the head of Big Brother. Even
        from the coin the eyes pursued you. On coins, on stamps, on the
        covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on  the  wrappings
        of  a  cigarette Packet — everywhere. Always the eyes watching
        you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake,  working  or
        eating,  indoors  or  out of doors, in the bath or in bed — no
        escape. Nothing was your own except the few  cubic  centimetres
        inside your skull.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="950"><span data-line="950"></span>The  sun  had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the
        Ministry of Truth, with the light no longer  shining  on  them,
        looked  grim  as the loopholes of a fortress. His heart quailed
        before the enormous pyramidal shape.  It  was  too  strong,  it
        could  not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not batter
        it down. He wondered again for whom he was writing  the  diary.
        For  the  future,  for  the  past  —  for an age that might be
        imaginary. And  in  front  of  him  there  lay  not  death  but
        annihilation.  The  diary would be reduced to ashes and himself
        to vapour. Only the Thought  Police  would  read  what  he  had
        written,  before  they  wiped  it  out  of existence and out of
        memory. How could you make appeal to  the  future  when  not  a
        trace  of  you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece
        of paper, could physically survive?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="965"><span data-line="965"></span>The telescreen struck  fourteen.  He  must  leave  in  ten
        minutes. He had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="968"><span data-line="968"></span>Curiously,  the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new
        heart into him. He was a lonely ghost  uttering  a  truth  that
        nobody  would  ever hear. But so long as he uttered it, in some
        obscure way the continuity was not broken. It was not by making
        yourself heard but by staying sane  that  you  carried  on  the
        human  heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and
        wrote:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="976"><span data-line="976"></span>To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is
        free, when men are different from one another and do  not  live
        alone — to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be
        undone:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="981"><span data-line="981"></span>From  the  age of uniformity, from the age of solitude,
        from the age of Big Brother, from the  age  of  doublethink  —
        greetings!
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="985"><span data-line="985"></span>He  was  already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that
        it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate  his
        thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. The consequences
        of every act are included in the act itself. He wrote:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="990"><span data-line="990"></span>Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS
        death.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="993"><span data-line="993"></span>Now  he  had  recognized  himself  as a dead man it became
        important to stay alive as long as possible. Two fingers of his
        right hand were inkstained. It was exactly the kind  of  detail
        that  might  betray  you. Some nosing zealot in the Ministry (a
        woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-haired woman or
        the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department)  might  start
        wondering  why  he  had been writing during the lunch interval,
        why he had used an old-fashioned pen, what  he  had  been
        writing  — and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter. He
        went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink  away  with
        the   gritty  dark-brown  soap  which  rasped  your  skin  like
        sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1006"><span data-line="1006"></span>He put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite  useless
        to  think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether
        or not its existence had been discovered. A  hair  laid  across
        the  page-ends  was  too obvious. With the tip of his finger he
        picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust  and  deposited
        it  on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shaken
        off if the book was moved.
</p><h2 id="sec--" class="h1" data-line="1014" data-heading-depth="1" style="display:block"><span data-line="1014"></span><span class="heading-before"><span class="heading-label">3</span>.&#8194;</span><span data-line="1014"></span> </h2>
<p class="p noindent" data-line="1016"><span data-line="1016"></span>Winston was dreaming of his mother.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1018"><span data-line="1018"></span>He must, he thought, have been ten  or  eleven  years  old
        when  his  mother  had disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque,
        rather silent woman with slow movements  and  magnificent  fair
        hair.  His  father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin,
        dressed  always  in  neat  dark  clothes  (Winston   remembered
        especially  the  very  thin  soles  of  his father<span data-line="1023"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1023"></span>s shoes) and
        wearing spectacles. The two of them must  evidently  have  been
        swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1027"><span data-line="1027"></span>At  this  moment his mother was sitting in some place deep
        down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms. He did not
        remember his sister at all, except  as  a  tiny,  feeble  baby,
        always  silent,  with  large,  watchful eyes. Both of them were
        looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean place —
        the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave — but
        it was a place which, already far below him, was itself  moving
        downwards.  They  were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking
        up at him through the darkening water. There was still  air  in
        the  saloon,  they could still see him and he them, but all the
        while they were sinking down, down into the green waters  which
        in  another  moment  must hide them from sight for ever. He was
        out in the light and air while they were being sucked  down  to
        death,  and they were down there because he was up here.
        He knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge  in
        their  faces. There was no reproach either in their faces or in
        their hearts, only the knowledge that they must  die  in  order
        that  he  might  remain  alive,  and  that this was part of the
        unavoidable order of things.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1047"><span data-line="1047"></span>He could not remember what had happened, but  he  knew  in
        his  dream  that  in  some  way the lives of his mother and his
        sister had been sacrificed to his own.  It  was  one  of  those
        dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery,
        are a continuation of one<span data-line="1051"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1051"></span>s intellectual life, and in which one
        becomes  aware  of  facts  and  ideas  which still seem new and
        valuable after one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck
        Winston was that his mother<span data-line="1054"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1054"></span>s death, nearly thirty  years  ago,
        had  been  tragic  and  sorrowful  in  a way that was no longer
        possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the ancient  time,
        to  a  time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship,
        and when the members of a family stood by one  another  without
        needing  to  know  the  reason. His mother<span data-line="1059"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1059"></span>s memory tore at his
        heart because she had died loving him, when he  was  too  young
        and  selfish to love her in return, and because somehow, he did
        not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception of
        loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he  saw,
        could  not  happen  today.  Today  there were fear, hatred, and
        pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep  or  complex  sorrows.
        All  this  he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and
        his sister, looking up at him through the green water, hundreds
        of fathoms down and still sinking.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1070"><span data-line="1070"></span>Suddenly he was standing  on  short  springy  turf,  on  a
        summer  evening  when  the  slanting rays of the sun gilded the
        ground. The landscape that he was looking at recurred so  often
        in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he
        had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he called
        it  the  Golden  Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture,
        with a foot-track wandering across it and a molehill  here  and
        there.  In  the  ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field
        the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very  faintly  in  the
        breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women<span data-line="1079"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1079"></span>s
        hair.  Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, there was a
        clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools
        under the willow trees.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1084"><span data-line="1084"></span>The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the
        field. With what seemed a single  movement  she  tore  off  her
        clothes  and  flung them disdainfully aside. Her body was white
        and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him, indeed  he  barely
        looked  at  it.  What  overwhelmed  him  in  that  instant  was
        admiration for the  gesture  with  which  she  had  thrown  her
        clothes  aside.  With  its  grace and carelessness it seemed to
        annihilate a whole culture,  a  whole  system  of  thought,  as
        though  Big  Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could
        all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement  of
        the  arm. That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time.
        Winston woke up with the word <span data-line="1095"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Shakespeare</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1095"></span> on his lips.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1097"><span data-line="1097"></span>The telescreen was giving forth an  ear-splitting  whistle
        which  continued  on  the  same note for thirty seconds. It was
        nought seven  fifteen,  getting-up  time  for  office  workers.
        Winston  wrenched his body out of bed — naked, for a member of
        the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons  annually,
        and a suit of pyjamas was 600 — and seized a dingy singlet and
        a  pair  of shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical
        Jerks would begin in three minutes.  The  next  moment  he  was
        doubled  up  by  a  violent  coughing  fit  which nearly always
        attacked him soon after waking up.  It  emptied  his  lungs  so
        completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on
        his  back  and  taking  a  series  of deep gasps. His veins had
        swelled with the effort of the cough, and  the  varicose  ulcer
        had started itching.

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1116"><span data-line="1116"></span>Winston sprang to attention in front  of  the  telescreen,
        upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular,
        dressed in tunic and gym-shoes, had already appeared.
</p>

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1126"><span data-line="1126"></span>The  pain  of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of
        Winston<span data-line="1127"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1127"></span>s mind the  impression  made  by  his  dream,  and  the
        rhythmic  movements of the exercise restored it somewhat. As he
        mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing on his  face
        the  look  of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during
        the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward
        into  the  dim  period  of  his   early   childhood.   It   was
        extraordinarily  difficult.  Beyond the late fifties everything
        faded. When there were no external records that you could refer
        to, even the outline of your own life lost its  sharpness.  You
        remembered  huge  events which had quite probably not happened,
        you remembered the detail of incidents without  being  able  to
        recapture  their  atmosphere, and there were long blank periods
        to  which  you  could  assign  nothing.  Everything  had   been
        different  then.  Even the names of countries, and their shapes
        on the map, had been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had
        not been so called in those days: it had been called England or
        Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been
        called London.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1146"><span data-line="1146"></span>Winston could not definitely  remember  a  time  when  his
        country  had not been at war, but it was evident that there had
        been a fairly long interval  of  peace  during  his  childhood,
        because  one  of  his  early  memories was of an air raid which
        appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the  time
        when  the  atomic  bomb  had  fallen  on Colchester. He did not
        remember the raid itself, but he did remember his father<span data-line="1152"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1152"></span>s hand
        clutching his own as they hurried down, down,  down  into  some
        place  deep  in  the  earth, round and round a spiral staircase
        which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs
        that he began whimpering and they had to  stop  and  rest.  His
        mother,  in  her  slow,  dreamy  way,  was following a long way
        behind them. She was carrying his baby sister — or perhaps  it
        was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying: he was not
        certain whether his sister had been born then. Finally they had
        emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be
        a Tube station.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1164"><span data-line="1164"></span>There  were  people  sitting  all  over  the stone-flagged
        floor, and other people, packed tightly together, were  sitting
        on metal bunks, one above the other. Winston and his mother and
        father  found themselves a place on the floor, and near them an
        old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on  a  bunk.
        The  old  man  had  on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap
        pushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and  his
        eyes  were  blue and full of tears. He reeked of gin. It seemed
        to breathe out of his skin in place of  sweat,  and  one  could
        have  fancied  that  the  tears welling from his eyes were pure
        gin. But though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some
        grief that was genuine and  unbearable.  In  his  childish  way
        Winston  grasped  that  some terrible thing, something that was
        beyond forgiveness  and  could  never  be  remedied,  had  just
        happened.  It  also  seemed  to  him  that he knew what it was.
        Someone whom the old  man  loved  —  a  little  granddaughter,
        perhaps  had  been  killed.  Every few minutes the old man kept
        repeating:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1183"><span data-line="1183"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We didn&#39;t ought to &#39;ave  trusted  &#39;em.  I  said  so,  Ma,
        didn&#39;t  I?  That&#39;s  what  comes  of trusting &#39;em. I said so all
        along. We didn&#39;t ought to &#39;ave trusted the buggers.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1185"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1187"><span data-line="1187"></span>But which  buggers  they  didn<span data-line="1187"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1187"></span>t  ought  to  have  trusted
        Winston could not now remember.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1190"><span data-line="1190"></span>Since  about that time, war had been literally continuous,
        though strictly speaking it had not always been the  same  war.
        For several months during his childhood there had been confused
        street  fighting  in London itself, some of which he remembered
        vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole  period,  to
        say  who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been
        utterly impossible, since no  written  record,  and  no  spoken
        word,  ever  made  mention  of  any  other  alignment  than the
        existing one. At this moment, for example, in 1984 (if  it  was
        1984),  Oceania  was  at  war with Eurasia and in alliance with
        Eastasia. In  no  public  or  private  utterance  was  it  ever
        admitted  that  the  three  powers had at any time been grouped
        along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew,  it  was
        only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and
        in  alliance  with  Eurasia.  But  that  was  merely a piece of
        furtive knowledge which he  happened  to  possess  because  his
        memory  was  not  satisfactorily  under control. Officially the
        change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war  with
        Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.
        The  enemy  of the moment always represented absolute evil, and
        it followed that any past or  future  agreement  with  him  was
        impossible.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1213"><span data-line="1213"></span>The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth
        time as  he forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands
        on hips, they were gyrating their bodies  from  the  waist,  an
        exercise  that was supposed to be good for the back muscles) —
        the frightening thing was that it might all  be  true.  If  the
        Party  could  thrust  its hand into the past and say of this or
        that event, it never happened — that, surely, was  more
        terrifying than mere torture and death?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1222"><span data-line="1222"></span>The  Party  said  that  Oceania had never been in alliance
        with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been  in
        alliance  with  Eurasia  as short a time as four years ago. But
        where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own  consciousness,
        which  in  any case must soon be annihilated. And if all others
        accepted the lie which the Party imposed<span data-line="1227"></span> <span data-line="1227"></span>-if all  records  told
        the  same  tale  — then the lie passed into history and became
        truth. <span data-line="1229"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Who controls the past,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1229"></span> ran the Party slogan, <span data-line="1229"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">controls
        the future: who controls the present controls  the  past.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1230"></span>  And
        yet  the  past,  though of its nature alterable, never had been
        altered. Whatever was true now was  true  from  everlasting  to
        everlasting.  It  was  quite simple. All that was needed was an
        unending series of victories over  your  own  memory.  <span data-line="1234"></span>&#8216;_Reality
        control&#8217;<span data-line="1235"></span>, they called it: in Newspeak, <span data-line="1235"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">doublethink</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1235"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1237"><span data-line="1237"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Stand  easy!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1237"></span>  barked  the  instructress,  a  little more
        genially.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1240"><span data-line="1240"></span>Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his
        lungs with air. His mind slid away into the labyrinthine  world
        of  doublethink.  To  know  and not to know, to be conscious of
        complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies,
        to  hold  simultaneously  two  opinions  which  cancelled  out,
        knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them,
        to  use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying
        claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and  that
        the  Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it
        was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again
        at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly  to  forget
        it  again:  and  above  all,  to  apply the same process to the
        process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously  to
        induce   unconsciousness,  and  then,  once  again,  to  become
        unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even
        to understand  the  word  <span data-line="1255"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">doublethink</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1255"></span>  involved  the  use  of
        doublethink.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1258"><span data-line="1258"></span>The  instructress had called them to attention again. <span data-line="1258"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And
        now let&#39;s see which  of  us  can  touch  our  toes!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1259"></span>  she  said
        enthusiastically.  <span data-line="1260"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Right over from the hips, please, comrades.
        One-two! One-two! …</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1261"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1263"><span data-line="1263"></span>Winston loathed this exercise, which sent  shooting  pains
        all  the  way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by
        bringing on another coughing  fit.  The  half-pleasant  quality
        went  out  of  his meditations. The past, he reflected, had not
        merely been altered, it had been actually  destroyed.  For  how
        could  you  establish  even  the  most  obvious fact when there
        existed no record outside your own memory? He tried to remember
        in what year he had first heard  mention  of  Big  Brother.  He
        thought  it  must have been at some time in the sixties, but it
        was impossible to  be  certain.  In  the  Party  histories,  of
        course,  Big  Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the
        Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had  been
        gradually  pushed backwards in time until already they extended
        into the fabulous world of the forties and the  thirties,  when
        the  capitalists  in  their strange cylindrical hats still rode
        through the streets of London in great gleaming  motor-cars  or
        horse carriages with glass sides. There was no knowing how much
        of  this  legend  was true and how much invented. Winston could
        not even remember at what date the Party itself had  come  into
        existence. He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc
        before   1960,  but  it  was  possible  that  in  its  Oldspeak
        form-<span data-line="1284"></span>&#8216;English Socialism&#8217;<span data-line="1284"></span>, that is to say — it had been current
        earlier. Everything melted into mist.  Sometimes,  indeed,  you
        could  put  your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for
        example, as was claimed in the Party history  books,  that  the
        Party  had  invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since
        his earliest childhood. But you could prove nothing. There  was
        never  any evidence. Just once in his whole life he had held in
        his hands unmistakable documentary proof of  the  falsification
        of an historical fact. And on that occasion
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1294"><span data-line="1294"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Smith!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1294"></span> screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen.
        <span data-line="1295"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">6079 Smith W.! Yes, you! Bend lower, please! You can do
        better   than   that.   You&#39;re   not   trying.  Lower,  please!
        That&#39;s better, comrade. Now stand  at  ease,  the  whole
        squad, and watch me.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1298"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1300"><span data-line="1300"></span>A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston<span data-line="1300"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1300"></span>s body.
        His face  remained  completely  inscrutable. Never show dismay!
        Never show resentment! A single flicker of the eyes could  give
        you  away.  He stood watching while the instructress raised her
        arms above her head and — one could not  say  gracefully,  but
        with remarkable neatness and efficiency — bent over and tucked
        the first joint of her fingers under her toes.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1308"><span data-line="1308"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There,  comrades!  That&#39;s how I want to see
        you doing it. Watch me again. I&#39;m thirty-nine and I&#39;ve had four
        children. Now look.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1310"></span> She bent over again.  <span data-line="1310"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  see  my  knees
        aren&#39;t  bent.  You  can all do it if you want to,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1311"></span> she added as
        she straightened herself  up.  <span data-line="1312"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Anyone  under  forty-five  is
        perfectly  capable  of touching his toes. We don&#39;t all have the
        privilege of fighting in the front line, but at  least  we  can
        all  keep  fit. Remember our boys on the Malabar front! And the
        sailors in the Floating Fortresses! Just think what they
        have to put up with. Now try  again.  That&#39;s  better,  comrade,
        that&#39;s much better,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1318"></span> she added encouragingly as Winston,
        with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees
        unbent, for the first time in several years.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="1324"><span data-line="1324"></span>With  the  deep,  unconscious  sigh  which  not  even  the
        nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering when
        his day<span data-line="1326"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1326"></span>s work started, Winston pulled the  speakwrite  towards
        him,  blew  the  dust  from  its  mouthpiece,  and  put  on his
        spectacles. Then he unrolled and clipped  together  four  small
        cylinders  of  paper  which  had  already  flopped  out  of the
        pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1332"><span data-line="1332"></span>In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices.  To
        the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written
        messages,  to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the
        side wall, within easy reach of Winston<span data-line="1335"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1335"></span>s arm, a  large  oblong
        slit  protected  by  a  wire  grating.  This  last  was for the
        disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands  or
        tens  of  thousands  throughout the building, not only in every
        room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some  reason
        they  were  nicknamed  memory  holes.  When  one  knew that any
        document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a  scrap
        of  waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift
        the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it  in,  whereupon
        it  would  be  whirled  away  on  a  current of warm air to the
        enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in  the  recesses
        of the building.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1348"><span data-line="1348"></span>Winston  examined  the  four  slips  of paper which he had
        unrolled. Each contained a message of only one or two lines, in
        the abbreviated jargon — not actually Newspeak, but consisting
        largely of Newspeak words — which was used in the Ministry for
        internal purposes. They ran:

<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="1359"><span data-line="1359"></span>With a faint feeling  of  satisfaction  Winston  laid  the

        and had better be dealt with last. The other three were routine
        matters, though the second one would probably mean some tedious
        wading through lists of figures.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1365"><span data-line="1365"></span>Winston dialled  <span data-line="1365"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">back  numbers</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1365"></span>  on  the  telescreen  and
        called  for  the  appropriate issues of The Times, which
        slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes<span data-line="1367"></span>_<span data-line="1367"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1367"></span> delay.
        The messages he had received referred to articles or news items
        which for one reason or another it  was  thought  necessary  to
        alter,  or,  as  the  official  phrase  had it, to rectify. For
        example, it appeared from The Times of  the  seventeenth
        of  March  that Big Brother, in his speech of the previous day,
        had predicted that the South Indian front  would  remain  quiet
        but  that  a  Eurasian  offensive  would shortly be launched in
        North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian Higher  Command  had
        launched  its  offensive  in  South India and left North Africa
        alone. It was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big
        Brother<span data-line="1378"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1378"></span>s speech, in such a way as  to  make  him  predict  the
        thing that had actually happened. Or again, The Times of
        the nineteenth of December had published the official forecasts
        of  the  output  of various classes of consumption goods in the
        fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the
        Ninth Three-Year Plan. Today<span data-line="1383"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1383"></span>s issue contained a  statement  of
        the  actual  output,  from which it appeared that the forecasts
        were in every instance grossly  wrong.  Winston<span data-line="1385"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1385"></span>s  job  was  to
        rectify  the  original  figures  by  making them agree with the
        later ones. As for the third message, it  referred  to  a  very
        simple  error  which could be set right in a couple of minutes.
        As short a time ago as February, the  Ministry  of  Plenty  had
        issued  a  promise  (a  <span data-line="1390"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">categorical  pledge</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1390"></span> were the official
        words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration
        during 1984. Actually, as  Winston  was  aware,  the  chocolate
        ration  was  to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the
        end of the present week. All that was needed was to  substitute
        for  the  original  promise a warning that it would probably be
        necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1398"><span data-line="1398"></span>As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he
        clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of
        The Times and  pushed  them  into  the  pneumatic
        tube.  Then,  with  a  movement which was as nearly as possible
        unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any  notes
        that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole
        to be devoured by the flames.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1406"><span data-line="1406"></span>What  happened  in  the  unseen  labyrinth  to  which  the
        pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know
        in general terms. As soon as all the corrections which happened
        to be necessary in any particular number  of  The  Times
        had   been   assembled  and  collated,  that  number  would  be
        reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected  copy
        placed  on  the  files in its stead. This process of continuous
        alteration was applied not only to newspapers,  but  to  books,
        periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks,
        cartoons,  photographs  —  to  every  kind  of  literature  or
        documentation which might conceivably  hold  any  political  or
        ideological  significance.  Day  by  day  and  almost minute by
        minute the past was brought up  to  date.  In  this  way  every
        prediction  made  by  the  Party  could be shown by documentary
        evidence to have been correct, nor was any item of news, or any
        expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs  of  the
        moment,  ever  allowed  to  remain on record. All history was a
        palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as  often  as
        was necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the
        deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place.
        The  largest section of the Records Department, far larger than
        the one on which Winston worked, consisted  simply  of  persons
        whose  duty  it  was  to  track  down and collect all copies of
        books,  newspapers,  and  other  documents   which   had   been
        superseded  and  were  due  for destruction. A number of The
        Times  which  might,  because  of  changes   in   political
        alignment,  or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother, have
        been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the  files  bearing
        its  original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it.
        Books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and  again,  and
        were   invariably  reissued  without  any  admission  that  any
        alteration had been made. Even the written  instructions  which
        Winston received, and which he invariably got rid of as soon as
        he  had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of
        forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips,
        errors, misprints, or misquotations which it was  necessary  to
        put right in the interests of accuracy.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1444"><span data-line="1444"></span>But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of
        Plenty<span data-line="1445"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1445"></span>s  figures,  it  was not even forgery. It was merely the
        substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of  the
        material  that  you  were  dealing  with  had no connexion with
        anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that
        is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just  as  much  a
        fantasy  in  their  original  version  as  in  their  rectified
        version. A great deal of the time you  were  expected  to  make
        them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty<span data-line="1452"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1452"></span>s
        forecast  had  estimated the output of boots for the quarter at
        145 million pairs. The actual output  was  given  as  sixty-two
        millions.  Winston,  however, in rewriting the forecast, marked
        the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the
        usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case,
        sixty-two millions was no  nearer  the  truth  than  fifty-seven
        millions,  or  than 145 millions. Very likely no boots had been
        produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had  been
        produced,  much less cared. All one knew was that every quarter
        astronomical numbers of boots were  produced  on  paper,  while
        perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it
        was  with  every  class  of  recorded  fact,  great  or  small.
        Everything faded away into a shadow-world  in  which,  finally,
        even the date of the year had become uncertain.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1468"><span data-line="1468"></span>Winston  glanced  across  the  hall.  In the corresponding
        cubicle on the  other  side  a  small,  precise-looking,  dark-
        chinned  man  named Tillotson was working steadily away, with a
        folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very  close  to  the
        mouthpiece  of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying to keep
        what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen.
        He looked up, and his spectacles  darted  a  hostile  flash  in
        Winston<span data-line="1475"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1475"></span>s direction.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1477"><span data-line="1477"></span>Winston  hardly  knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work
        he was employed on. People in the Records  Department  did  not
        readily  talk  about  their jobs. In the long, windowless hall,
        with its double row of  cubicles  and  its  endless  rustle  of
        papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were
        quite  a  dozen  people whom Winston did not even know by name,
        though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in  the  corridors
        or  gesticulating  in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in the
        cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day
        in day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from the Press
        the names of people who had been vaporized and  were  therefore
        considered  never  to have existed. There was a certain fitness
        in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a  couple  of
        years  earlier.  And  a  few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual,
        dreamy creature named Ampleforth, with very hairy  ears  and  a
        surprising  talent  for  juggling  with  rhymes and metres, was
        engaged in producing garbled versions — definitive texts, they
        were  called  —  of  poems  which  had  become   ideologically
        offensive,  but  which  for  one  reason  or another were to be
        retained in the anthologies. And  this  hall,  with  its  fifty
        workers  or  thereabouts,  was  only  one sub-section, a single
        cell, as it  were,  in  the  huge  complexity  of  the  Records
        Department.  Beyond, above, below, were other swarms of workers
        engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs.  There  were  the
        huge  printing-shops  with  their  sub-editors, their typography
        experts, and their elaborately equipped studios for the  faking
        of  photographs. There was the tele-programmes section with its
        engineers, its producers, and its  teams  of  actors  specially
        chosen  for  their  skill  in  imitating voices. There were the
        armies of reference clerks whose job  was  simply  to  draw  up
        lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall. There
        were  the  vast repositories where the corrected documents were
        stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies  were
        destroyed.  And somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were
        the directing brains who co-ordinated the whole effort and laid
        down the lines of policy which  made  it  necessary  that  this
        fragment  of  the past should be preserved, that one falsified,
        and the other rubbed out of existence.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1516"><span data-line="1516"></span>And the Records Department, after all, was itself  only  a
        single  branch  of the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was
        not to reconstruct the past  but  to  supply  the  citizens  of
        Oceania   with   newspapers,   films,   textbooks,   telescreen
        programmes, plays, novels — with  every  conceivable  kind  of
        information,  instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a
        slogan, from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from  a
        child<span data-line="1523"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1523"></span>s   spelling-book  to  a  Newspeak  dictionary.  And  the
        Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs  of  the
        party,  but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level
        for the benefit of the proletariat. There was a whole chain  of
        separate   departments  dealing  with  proletarian  literature,
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="1529" style="display:block"><code>    music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here  were  produced
    rubbishy  newspapers  containing  almost  nothing except sport,
    crime and astrology, sensational  five-cent  novelettes,  films
    oozing  with  sex,  and  sentimental  songs which were composed
    entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of  kaleidoscope
    known  as a versificator. There was even a whole sub-section —
    Pornosec, it  was  called  in  Newspeak  —  engaged  in
    producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in
    sealed  packets and which no Party member, other than those who
    worked on it, was permitted to look at.</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="1540"><span data-line="1540"></span>Three messages had slid out of the  pneumatic  tube  while
        Winston  was  working, but they were simple matters, and he had
        disposed of them before the Two Minutes Hate  interrupted  him.
        When  the  Hate  was  over he returned to his cubicle, took the
        Newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed  the  speakwrite  to
        one  side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his main
        job of the morning.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1548"><span data-line="1548"></span>Winston<span data-line="1548"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1548"></span>s greatest pleasure in life was in his work.  Most
        of it was a tedious routine, but included in it there were also
        jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in
        them  as  in  the  depths of a mathematical problem — delicate
        pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you  except
        your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your estimate of
        what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was good at this kind
        of  thing.  On  occasion  he  had  even been entrusted with the
        rectification of The Times leading articles, which  were
        written  entirely  in Newspeak. He unrolled the message that he
        had set aside earlier.  It  ran:

<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="1564"><span data-line="1564"></span>In  Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered:
        The reporting of Big Brother<span data-line="1565"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1565"></span>s Order for the Day in  The  Times
        of  December  3rd  1983  is  extremely unsatisfactory and makes
        references to non-existent persons.  Rewrite  it  in  full  and
        submit your draft to higher authority before filing.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1570"><span data-line="1570"></span>Winston  read through the offending article. Big Brother<span data-line="1570"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1570"></span>s
        Order for the Day, it  seemed,  had  been  chiefly  devoted  to
        praising  the  work  of  an  organization  known as FFCC, which
        supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the  sailors  in  the
        Floating  Fortresses.  A  certain  Comrade Withers, a prominent
        member of the Inner Party, had been  singled  out  for  special
        mention  and  awarded  a  decoration,  the Order of Conspicuous
        Merit, Second Class.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1579"><span data-line="1579"></span>Three months later FFCC had suddenly been  dissolved  with
        no  reasons  given.  One  could  assume  that  Withers  and his
        associates were now in disgrace, but there had been  no  report
        of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen. That was to be
        expected,  since  it  was unusual for political offenders to be
        put on trial or  even  publicly  denounced.  The  great  purges
        involving  thousands  of people, with public trials of traitors
        and thought-criminals  who  made  abject  confession  of  their
        crimes  and  were afterwards executed, were special show-pieces
        not occurring oftener than once in  a  couple  of  years.  More
        commonly,  people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party
        simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had
        the smallest clue as to what had  happened  to  them.  In  some
        cases  they  might  not  even  be  dead.  Perhaps thirty people
        personally known to Winston,  not  counting  his  parents,  had
        disappeared at one time or another.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1596"><span data-line="1596"></span>Winston  stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In the
        cubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson  was  still  crouching
        secretively  over  his  speakwrite.  He  raised  his head for a
        moment: again the  hostile  spectacle-flash.  Winston  wondered
        whether  Comrade  Tillotson  was  engaged  on  the  same job as
        himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece  of  work
        would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand,
        to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an
        act  of  fabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a
        dozen people were now working away on rival  versions  of  what
        Big  Brother had actually said. And presently some master brain
        in the Inner Party would select this  version  or  that,  would
        re-edit   it  and  set  in  motion  the  complex  processes  of
        cross-referencing that would be required, and then  the  chosen
        lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1612"><span data-line="1612"></span>Winston  did  not  know  why  Withers  had been disgraced.
        Perhaps it was for  corruption  or  incompetence.  Perhaps  Big
        Brother  was  merely  getting rid of a too-popular subordinate.
        Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been  suspected  of
        heretical  tendencies.  Or perhaps — what was likeliest of all
        — the  thing  had   simply   happened   because   purges   and
        vaporizations  were  a  necessary  part  of  the  mechanics  of
        government.  The  only  real  clue  lay  in  the  words   <span data-line="1619"></span>&#8216;_refs
        unpersons&#8217;<span data-line="1620"></span>,  which indicated that Withers was already dead. You
        could not invariably assume this to be  the  case  when  people
        were  arrested.  Sometimes  they  were  released and allowed to
        remain at liberty for as much as a year  or  two  years  before
        being  executed.  Very  occasionally  some  person whom you had
        believed dead long since would make a ghostly  reappearance  at
        some  public  trial where he would implicate hundreds of others
        by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever. Withers,
        however, was already an unperson. He did not  exist:  he
        had  never existed. Winston decided that it would not be enough
        simply to reverse the tendency of Big Brother<span data-line="1630"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1630"></span>s speech. It  was
        better  to make it deal with something totally unconnected with
        its original subject.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1634"><span data-line="1634"></span>He might turn the speech into the  usual  denunciation  of
        traitors  and  thought-criminals,  but  that  was  a little too
        obvious, while to invent  a  victory  at  the  front,  or  some
        triumph  of over-production in the Ninth Three-Year Plan, might
        complicate the records too much. What was needed was a piece of
        pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind,  ready  made
        as  it  were,  the  image  of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had
        recently died in battle, in heroic  circumstances.  There  were
        occasions  when  Big  Brother  devoted his Order for the Day to
        commemorating some humble, rank-and-file Party member whose life
        and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed. Today
        he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It was  true  that  there
        was  no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print
        and a couple of faked photographs would  soon  bring  him  into
        existence.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1650"><span data-line="1650"></span>Winston  thought  for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite
        towards him and  began  dictating  in  Big  Brother<span data-line="1651"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1651"></span>s  familiar
        style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a
        trick  of  asking  questions  and  then promptly answering them
        (<span data-line="1654"></span>&#8216;What lessons do we learn  from  this  fact,  comrades?  The
        lesson  —  which  is also one of the fundamental principles of
        Ingsoc — that,_&#8217;<span data-line="1656"></span> etc., etc.), easy to imitate.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1658"><span data-line="1658"></span>At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had  refused  all  toys
        except  a  drum,  a sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. At
        six — a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules — he
        had joined the Spies, at nine he had been a  troop  leader.  At
        eleven  he  had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police after
        overhearing a  conversation  which  appeared  to  him  to  have
        criminal  tendencies.  At  seventeen  he  had  been  a district
        organizer of the Junior Anti-Sex League. At nine  teen  he  had
        designed  a hand-grenade which had been adopted by the Ministry
        of Peace and which, at its first trial,  had  killed  thirty-one
        Eurasian  prisoners  in  one  burst.  At  twenty-three  he  had
        perished in action. Pursued by enemy jet  planes  while  flying
        over  the  Indian  Ocean  with  important  despatches,  he  had
        weighted his body with his machine gun and  leapt  out  of  the
        helicopter  into deep water, despatches and all — an end, said
        Big Brother, which it was  impossible  to  contemplate  without
        feelings of envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity
        and  single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy<span data-line="1675"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1675"></span>s life. He was a total
        abstainer and a nonsmoker, had no recreations  except  a  daily
        hour  in  the  gymnasium,  and  had  taken  a  vow of celibacy,
        believing marriage and the care of a family to be  incompatible
        with  a  twenty-four-hour-a-day  devotion  to  duty.  He had no
        subjects of conversation except the principles of  Ingsoc,  and
        no  aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the
        hunting-down  of  spies,   saboteurs,   thoughtcriminals,   and
        traitors generally.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1685"><span data-line="1685"></span>Winston  debated  with  himself  whether  to award Comrade
        Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit: in the  end  he  decided
        against it because of the unnecessary cross-referencing that it
        would entail.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1690"><span data-line="1690"></span>Once  again  he  glanced  at  his  rival  in  the opposite
        cubicle. Something seemed  to  tell  him  with  certainty  that
        Tillotson was busy on the same job as himself. There was no way
        of  knowing  whose  job would finally be adopted, but he felt a
        profound conviction that it would be his own.  Comrade  Ogilvy,
        unimagined  an  hour  ago,  was  now  a  fact. It struck him as
        curious that you could create dead men  but  not  living  ones.
        Comrade  Ogilvy,  who  had  never  existed  in the present, now
        existed in the past, and when  once  the  act  of  forgery  was
        forgotten,  he  would exist just as authentically, and upon the
        same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="1704"><span data-line="1704"></span>In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the  lunch
        queue jerked slowly forward. The room was already very full and
        deafeningly  noisy. From the grille at the counter the steam of
        stew came pouring forth, with a sour metallic smell  which  did
        not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On the far side of
        the  room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall, where
        gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1712"><span data-line="1712"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Just the  man  I  was  looking  for,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1712"></span>  said  a  voice  at
        Winston<span data-line="1713"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1713"></span>s back.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1715"><span data-line="1715"></span>He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in the
        Research Department. Perhaps <span data-line="1716"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">friend</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1716"></span> was not exactly the right
        word.  You did not have friends nowadays, you had comrades: but
        there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that
        of others. Syme was a philologist, a  specialist  in  Newspeak.
        Indeed,  he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged
        in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the  Newspeak  Dictionary.
        He  was  a  tiny creature, smaller than Winston, with dark hair
        and large, protuberant eyes, at  once  mournful  and  derisive,
        which  seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking
        to you.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1727"><span data-line="1727"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I wanted to ask you whether you&#39;d got any razor  blades,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1727"></span>
        he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1730"><span data-line="1730"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Not one!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1730"></span> said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. <span data-line="1730"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;ve
        tried all over the place. They don&#39;t exist any longer.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1731"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1733"><span data-line="1733"></span>Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he had
        two unused  ones  which  he  was  hoarding up. There had been a
        famine of them for months past. At any given moment  there  was
        some  necessary  article  which  the Party shops were unable to
        supply. Sometimes it was  buttons,  sometimes  it  was  darning
        wool,  sometimes  it  was  shoelaces;  at  present it was razor
        blades. You could  only  get  hold  of  them,  if  at  all,  by
        scrounging more or less furtively on the <span data-line="1740"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">free</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1740"></span> market.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1742"><span data-line="1742"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;ve  been  using the same blade for six weeks,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1742"></span> he added
        untruthfully.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1745"><span data-line="1745"></span>The queue gave another jerk forward.  As  they  halted  he
        turned  and  faced Syme again. Each of them took a greasy metal
        tray from a pile at the end of the counter.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1749"><span data-line="1749"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1749"></span>  said
        Syme.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1752"><span data-line="1752"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  was working,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1752"></span> said Winston indifferently. <span data-line="1752"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I shall see
        it on the flicks, I suppose.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1753"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1755"><span data-line="1755"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">A very inadequate substitute,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1755"></span> said Syme.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1757"><span data-line="1757"></span>His mocking eyes roved over Winston<span data-line="1757"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1757"></span>s face. <span data-line="1757"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I know  you,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1757"></span>
        the  eyes  seemed  to say, <span data-line="1758"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I see through you. I know very well
        why you didn&#39;t  go  to  see  those  prisoners  hanged.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1759"></span>  In  an
        intellectual  way,  Syme was venomously orthodox. He would talk
        with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of  helicopter  raids
        on    enemy   villages,   and   trials   and   confessions   of
        thought-criminals,  the  executions  in  the  cellars  of   the
        Ministry  of  Love.  Talking  to  him  was  largely a matter of
        getting him away from such  subjects  and  entangling  him,  if
        possible,  in  the  technicalities of Newspeak, on which he was
        authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head a little
        aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1770"><span data-line="1770"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It was a good hanging,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1770"></span> said Syme reminiscently. <span data-line="1770"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I think
        it spoils it when they tie their feet together. I like  to  see
        them  kicking.  And  above all, at the end, the tongue sticking
        right out, and blue a quite bright blue. That&#39;s the detail that
        appeals to me.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1774"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1776"><span data-line="1776"></span>&#8216;_Nex&#8217;<span data-line="1776"></span>, please!<span data-line="1776"></span>_<span data-line="1776"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1776"></span> yelled the white-aproned  prole  with  the
        ladle.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1779"><span data-line="1779"></span>Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. On
        to each  was  dumped  swiftly  the  regulation lunch — a metal
        pannikin of pinkish-grey stew, a  hunk  of  bread,  a  cube  of
        cheese,  a  mug  of milkless Victory Coffee, and one saccharine
        tablet.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1785"><span data-line="1785"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There&#39;s a table over there, under that telescreen,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1785"></span>  said
        Syme. <span data-line="1786"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Let&#39;s pick up a gin on the way.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1786"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1788"><span data-line="1788"></span>The  gin  was served out to them in handleless china mugs.
        They threaded their way across the crowded  room  and  unpacked
        their  trays  on  to  the  metal-topped table, on one corner of
        which someone had left a pool of stew,  a  filthy  liquid  mess
        that  had  the  appearance of vomit. Winston took up his mug of
        gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the
        oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the  tears  out  of
        his  eyes  he  suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began
        swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among  its  general
        sloppiness,  had  cubes  of  spongy  pinkish  stuff  which  was
        probably a preparation of meat. Neither  of  them  spoke  again
        till  they  had  emptied  their  pannikins.  From  the table at
        Winston<span data-line="1800"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1800"></span>s left, a little behind his back, someone  was  talking
        rapidly  and  continuously,  a  harsh  gabble  almost  like the
        quacking of a duck, which pierced the  general  uproar  of  the
        room.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1805"><span data-line="1805"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">How  is the Dictionary getting on?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1805"></span> said Winston, raising
        his voice to overcome the noise.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1808"><span data-line="1808"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Slowly,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1808"></span>  said  Syme.  <span data-line="1808"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;m  on  the   adjectives.   It&#39;s
        fascinating.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1809"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1811"><span data-line="1811"></span>He  had  brightened  up  immediately  at  the  mention  of
        Newspeak. He pushed his pannikin aside, took  up  his  hunk  of
        bread  in  one  delicate  hand and his cheese in the other, and
        leaned across the table so as  to  be  able  to  speak  without
        shouting.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1817"><span data-line="1817"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1817"></span> he said.
        <span data-line="1818"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We&#39;re  getting  the language into its final shape — the shape
        it&#39;s going to have when nobody speaks anything else. When we&#39;ve
        finished with it, people like you will have  to  learn  it  all
        over  again.  You  think,  I  dare  say,  that our chief job is
        inventing new words. But not a  bit  of  it!  We&#39;re  destroying
        words  —  scores  of  them, hundreds of them, every day. We&#39;re
        cutting the language down to the  bone.  The  Eleventh  Edition
        won&#39;t  contain  a  single word that will become obsolete before
        the year 2050.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1826"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1828"><span data-line="1828"></span>He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a  couple  of
        mouthfuls,  then  continued  speaking,  with a sort of pedant<span data-line="1829"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1829"></span>s
        passion. His thin dark face had become animated, his  eyes  had
        lost their mocking expression and grown almost dreamy.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1833"><span data-line="1833"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s  a  beautiful  thing,  the  destruction of words. Of
        course the great wastage is in the verbs  and  adjectives,  but
        there  are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It
        isn&#39;t only the synonyms; there are  also  the  antonyms.  After
        all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the
        opposite  of  some  other word? A word contains its opposite in
        itself. Take &#8220;good&#8221;, for instance. If  you  have  a  word  like
        &#8220;good&#8221;, what need is there for a word like &#8220;bad&#8221;? &#8220;Ungood&#8221; will
        do  just  as  well  —  better, because it&#39;s an exact opposite,
        which the other is not.  Or  again,  if  you  want  a  stronger
        version of &#8220;good&#8221;, what sense is there in having a whole string
        of  vague useless words like &#8220;excellent&#8221; and &#8220;splendid&#8221; and all
        the  rest  of  them?  &#8220;Plusgood&#8221;  covers  the  meaning,  or   &#8220;
        doubleplusgood&#8221; if you want something stronger still. Of course
        we  use  those  forms  already.  but  in  the  final version of
        Newspeak there&#39;ll be nothing else. In the end the whole  notion
        of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words — in
        reality,  only  one  word.  Don&#39;t  you  see the beauty of that,
        Winston? It was B.B.&#39;s idea originally, of course,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1851"></span> he added as
        an afterthought.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1854"><span data-line="1854"></span>A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston<span data-line="1854"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1854"></span>s face at
        the mention  of  Big  Brother.  Nevertheless  Syme  immediately
        detected a certain lack of enthusiasm.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1858"><span data-line="1858"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You haven&#39;t a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1858"></span> he
        said almost  sadly.  <span data-line="1859"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Even  when  you  write  it  you&#39;re  still
        thinking in Oldspeak. I&#39;ve read some of those pieces  that  you
        write  in  The  Times  occasionally. They&#39;re good
        enough, but they&#39;re translations. In your heart you&#39;d prefer to
        stick to Oldspeak, with  all  its  vagueness  and  its  useless
        shades   of   meaning.  You  don&#39;t  grasp  the  beauty  of  the
        destruction of words. Do you know that  Newspeak  is  the  only
        language  in  the  world  whose  vocabulary  gets smaller every
        year?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1867"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1869"><span data-line="1869"></span>Winston   did   know   that,   of   course.   He   smiled,
        sympathetically  he  hoped, not trusting himself to speak. Syme
        bit off another fragment of the dark-coloured bread, chewed  it
        briefly, and went on:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1874"><span data-line="1874"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Don&#39;t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow
        the range  of  thought?  In  the end we shall make thoughtcrime
        literally impossible, because there will be no words  in  which
        to  express  it. Every concept that can ever be needed, will be
        expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning  rigidly
        defined   and  all  its  subsidiary  meanings  rubbed  out  and
        forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we&#39;re not far from
        that point. But the process will still be continuing long after
        you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words,  and  the
        range  of  consciousness  always a little smaller. Even now, of
        course,  there&#39;s   no   reason   or   excuse   for   committing
        thoughtcrime.   It&#39;s  merely  a  question  of  self-discipline,
        reality-control. But in the end there won&#39;t be  any  need  even
        for  that. The Revolution will be complete when the language is
        perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1888"></span>  he  added
        with  a sort of mystical satisfaction. <span data-line="1889"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Has it ever occurred to
        you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not  a
        single  human  being  will be alive who could understand such a
        conversation as we are having now?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1892"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1894"><span data-line="1894"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Except-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1894"></span> began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1896"><span data-line="1896"></span>It had been on the tip of his tongue to  say  <span data-line="1896"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Except  the
        proles,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1897"></span> but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that
        this  remark was not in some way unorthodox. Syme, however, had
        divined what he was about to say.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1901"><span data-line="1901"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The proles are not human beings,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1901"></span> he said  carelessly.  <span data-line="1901"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">
        By  2050  earlier,  probably  — all real knowledge of Oldspeak
        will have disappeared. The whole literature of  the  past  will
        have  been  destroyed.  Chaucer,  Shakespeare, Milton, Byron —
        they&#39;ll exist only in Newspeak  versions,  not  merely  changed
        into  something  different, but actually changed into something
        contradictory of what they used to be. Even the  literature  of
        the  Party will change. Even the slogans will change. How could
        you have a slogan like &#8220;freedom is slavery&#8221; when the concept of
        freedom has been abolished? The whole climate of  thought  will
        be  different.  In  fact there will be no thought, as we
        understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking — not  needing
        to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1913"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1915"><span data-line="1915"></span>One  of  these  days,  thought  Winston  with  sudden deep
        conviction, Syme will be vaporized. He is too  intelligent.  He
        sees  too  clearly  and  speaks too plainly. The Party does not
        like such people. One day he will disappear. It is  written  in
        his face.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1921"><span data-line="1921"></span>Winston  had  finished  his  bread and cheese. He turned a
        little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At the
        table on his left the man with the  strident  voice  was  still
        talking  remorselessly  away. A young woman who was perhaps his
        secretary, and who was sitting with her back  to  Winston,  was
        listening  to  him  and  seemed  to  be  eagerly  agreeing with
        everything that he said. From time to time Winston caught  some
        such  remark as <span data-line="1928"></span>&#8216;_I think you&#39;re so right, I do so
        agree with  you&#8217;<span data-line="1929"></span>,  uttered  in  a  youthful  and  rather  silly
        feminine  voice.  But  the  other  voice  never  stopped for an
        instant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the  man
        by  sight,  though  he knew no more about him than that he held
        some important post in the Fiction Department. He was a man  of
        about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth.
        His  head was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at
        which he was sitting,  his  spectacles  caught  the  light  and
        presented  to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was
        slightly horrible, was that  from  the  stream  of  sound  that
        poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish
        a  single word. Just once Winston caught a phrase-<span data-line="1940"></span>&#8216;complete and
        final elimination of Goldsteinism&#8217;<span data-line="1941"></span>-  jerked  out  very  rapidly
        and,  as  it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast
        solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking.
        And yet, though you could not actually hear what  the  man  was
        saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature.
        He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures
        against   thought-criminals   and  saboteurs,  he  might  be
        fulminating against the atrocities of  the  Eurasian  army,  he
        might  be  praising  Big  Brother  or the heroes on the Malabar
        front-it made no difference. Whatever  it  was,  you  could  be
        certain  that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc.
        As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving  rapidly  up
        and  down,  Winston  had  a curious feeling that this was not a
        real human being but some kind of dummy. It was not  the  man<span data-line="1954"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1954"></span>s
        brain  that was speaking, it was his larynx. The stuff that was
        coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech  in
        the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like
        the quacking of a duck.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1960"><span data-line="1960"></span>Syme  had  fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle
        of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle  of  stew.  The
        voice  from  the other table quacked rapidly on, easily audible
        in spite of the surrounding din.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1965"><span data-line="1965"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There is a word in Newspeak,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1965"></span> said Syme,  <span data-line="1965"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  don&#39;t  know
        whether you know it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck. It
        is  one  of those interesting words that have two contradictory
        meanings. Applied to an  opponent,  it  is  abuse,  applied  to
        someone you agree with, it is praise.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1969"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1971"><span data-line="1971"></span>Unquestionably  Syme  will  be  vaporized, Winston thought
        again. He thought it with a  kind  of  sadness,  although  well
        knowing  that  Syme despised him and slightly disliked him, and
        was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-criminal  if
        he  saw  any  reason  for  doing so. There was something subtly
        wrong  with  Syme.  There  was  something   that   he   lacked:
        discretion,  aloofness,  a  sort of saving stupidity. You could
        not say that he was unorthodox. He believed in  the  principles
        of   Ingsoc,   he  venerated  Big  Brother,  he  rejoiced  over
        victories, he hated heretics, not  merely  with  sincerity  but
        with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of information,
        which  the  ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faint
        air of disreputability always clung to him. He said things that
        would have been better unsaid, he had read too many  books,  he
        frequented  the  Chestnut  Tree  Café,  haunt  of painters and
        musicians. There was no law, not even an unwritten law, against
        frequenting the Chestnut Tree Café, yet the place was  somehow
        ill-omened.  The old, discredited leaders of the Party had been
        used to gather there before they were finally purged. Goldstein
        himself, it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years  and
        decades  ago. Syme<span data-line="1991"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1991"></span>s fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet
        it was a fact that if Syme grasped, even for three seconds, the
        nature of his, Winston<span data-line="1993"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1993"></span>s, secret opinions, he would betray  him
        instantly  to  the  Thought  police. So would anybody else, for
        that matter: but Syme more than  most.  Zeal  was  not  enough.
        Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="1998"><span data-line="1998"></span>Syme looked up. <span data-line="1998"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Here comes Parsons,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="1998"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2000"><span data-line="2000"></span>Something  in  the  tone of his voice seemed to add, <span data-line="2000"></span>&#8216;_that
        bloody  fool&#8217;<span data-line="2001"></span>.  Parsons,  Winston<span data-line="2001"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2001"></span>s  fellow-tenant  at  Victory
        Mansions,  was  in  fact threading his way across the room — a
        tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face.  At
        thirty-five  he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and
        waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish.  His  whole
        appearance  was  that  of  a little boy grown large, so much so
        that although he was wearing the regulation  overalls,  it  was
        almost  impossible  not to think of him as being dressed in the
        blue shorts, grey shirt, and red neckerchief of the  Spies.  In
        visualizing  him  one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and
        sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons  did,  indeed,
        invariably  revert to shorts when a community hike or any other
        physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so.  He  greeted
        them  both  with  a  cheery <span data-line="2014"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Hullo, hullo!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2014"></span> and sat down at the
        table, giving off an intense smell of sweat. Beads of  moisture
        stood  out  all over his pink face. His powers of sweating were
        extraordinary. At the Community Centre you  could  always  tell
        when  he  had  been playing table-tennis by the dampness of the
        bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on  which  there
        was  a  long  column  of  words,  and  was  studying it with an
        ink-pencil between his fingers.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2023"><span data-line="2023"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Look at  him  working  away  in  the  lunch  hour,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2023"></span>  said
        Parsons, nudging Winston. <span data-line="2024"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Keenness, eh? What&#39;s that you&#39;ve got
        there,  old  boy?  Something a bit too brainy for me, I expect.
        Smith, old boy, I&#39;ll tell you why I&#39;m chasing  you.  It&#39;s  that
        sub you forgot to give me.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2027"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2029"><span data-line="2029"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2029"></span>_<span data-line="2029"></span>Which  sub  is  that? said Winston, automatically feeling
        for money. About a quarter of one<span data-line="2030"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2030"></span>s salary had to be  earmarked
        for voluntary subscriptions, which were so numerous that it was
        difficult to keep track of them.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2034"><span data-line="2034"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">For  Hate  Week. You know — the house-by-house fund. I&#39;m
        treasurer for our block. We&#39;re  making  an  all-out  effort  —
        going  to  put on a tremendous show. I tell you, it won&#39;t be my
        fault if old Victory Mansions doesn&#39;t have the  biggest  outfit
        of flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2038"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2040"><span data-line="2040"></span>Winston  found  and  handed  over  two  creased and filthy
        notes, which Parsons entered in a small notebook, in  the  neat
        handwriting of the illiterate.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2044"><span data-line="2044"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">By the way, old boy,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2044"></span> he said. <span data-line="2044"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2044"></span>_<span data-line="2044"></span>I hear that little beggar
        of mine  let fly at you with his catapult yesterday. I gave him
        a good dressing-down for it. In fact I told  him  I<span data-line="2046"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2046"></span>d  take  the
        catapult away if he does it again.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2049"><span data-line="2049"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  think  he  was  a  little  upset  at  not going to the
        execution,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2050"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2052"><span data-line="2052"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"> Ah, well — what I mean to say, shows the right  spirit,
        doesn&#39;t  it? Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them,
        but talk about keenness! All they think about is the Spies, and
        the war, of course. D&#39;you know what that little  girl  of  mine
        did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike out Berkhamsted
        way?  She  got two other girls to go with her, slipped off from
        the hike, and spent the whole  afternoon  following  a  strange
        man.  They  kept  on  his tail for two hours, right through the
        woods, and then, when they got into Amersham, handed  him  over
        to the patrols.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2061"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2063"><span data-line="2063"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What  did they do that for?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2063"></span> said Winston, somewhat taken
        aback. Parsons went on triumphantly:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2066"><span data-line="2066"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent — might
        have been dropped by parachute, for instance.  But  here&#39;s  the
        point,  old  boy.  What  do  you think put her on to him in the
        first place? She spotted he was wearing a funny kind  of  shoes
        — said she&#39;d never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before.
        So  the  chances  were  he  was a foreigner. Pretty smart for a
        nipper of seven, eh?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2072"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2074"><span data-line="2074"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What happened to the man?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2074"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2076"><span data-line="2076"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Ah, that I couldn&#39;t say, of course.  But  I  wouldn&#39;t  be
        altogether  surprised  if-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2077"></span> Parsons made the motion of aiming a
        rifle, and clicked his tongue for the explosion.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2080"><span data-line="2080"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Good,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2080"></span> said Syme abstractedly, without  looking  up  from
        his strip of paper.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2083"><span data-line="2083"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Of  course  we  can&#39;t  afford  to  take  chances,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2083"></span> agreed
        Winston dutifully.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2086"><span data-line="2086"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What I mean to say, there is a war on,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2086"></span> said Parsons.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2088"><span data-line="2088"></span>As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call  floated
        from the telescreen just above their heads. However, it was not
        the proclamation of a military victory this time, but merely an
        announcement from the Ministry of Plenty.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2093"><span data-line="2093"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Comrades!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2093"></span>  cried  an  eager  youthful voice. <span data-line="2093"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Attention,
        comrades! We have glorious news for you. We have won the battle
        for production! Returns now completed  of  the  output  of  all
        classes  of  consumption goods show that the standard of living
        has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past  year.  All
        over  Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous
        demonstrations  when  workers  marched  out  of  factories  and
        offices  and  paraded  through the streets with banners voicing
        their gratitude to Big Brother for the new,  happy  life  which
        his  wise leadership has bestowed upon us. Here are some of the
        completed figures. Foodstuffs-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2103"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2105"><span data-line="2105"></span>The phrase <span data-line="2105"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">our new, happy life</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2105"></span> recurred  several  times.
        It  had  been  a favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty.
        Parsons,  his  attention  caught  by  the  trumpet  call,   sat
        listening  with  a  sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified
        boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was aware that
        they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He  had  lugged
        out  a  huge  and  filthy  pipe  which was already half full of
        charred tobacco. With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a  week
        it  was  seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top. Winston was
        smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal.
        The new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four
        cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut  his  ears  to  the
        remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out
        of  the  telescreen.  It  appeared  that  there  had  even been
        demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising  the  chocolate
        ration  to  twenty  grammes  a  week.  And  only  yesterday, he
        reflected, it had been announced that  the  ration  was  to  be
        reduced  to  twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that
        they could swallow that, after  only  twenty-four  hours?  Yes,
        they  swallowed  it.  Parsons  swallowed  it  easily,  with the
        stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature at the other table
        swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a  furious  desire
        to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest
        that last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too-in
        some  more  complex  way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed
        it. Was he, then, alone in the possession of a memory?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2132"><span data-line="2132"></span>The fabulous statistics  continued  to  pour  out  of  the
        telescreen.  As  compared  with  last year there was more food,
        more clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cooking-pots,
        more  fuel,  more  ships,  more  helicopters,  more books, more
        babies  —  more  of  everything  except  disease,  crime,  and
        insanity.  Year  by  year  and  minute by minute, everybody and
        everything was whizzing  rapidly  upwards.  As  Syme  had  done
        earlier  Winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the
        pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across the table,  drawing  a
        long  streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated resentfully
        on the physical texture of life. Had it always been like  this?
        Had  food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen.
        A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact
        of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed
        so close together that  you  sat  with  elbows  touching;  bent
        spoons,  dented  trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy,
        grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad gin
        and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes.  Always  in
        your  stomach  and  in your skin there was a sort of protest, a
        feeling that you had been cheated of something that you  had  a
        right  to.  It  was  true  that  he had no memories of anything
        greatly  different.  In  any  time  that  he  could  accurately
        remember,  there  had  never  been quite enough to eat, one had
        never had socks or underclothes that were not  full  of  holes,
        furniture   had   always   been  battered  and  rickety,  rooms
        underheated, tube trains crowded,  houses  falling  to  pieces,
        bread  dark-coloured,  tea  a  rarity, coffee filthy-tasting,
        cigarettes insufficient — nothing cheap and  plentiful  except
        synthetic  gin.  And  though, of course, it grew worse as one<span data-line="2160"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2160"></span>s
        body aged, was it not a  sign  that  this  was  not  the
        natural  order  of  things,  if  one<span data-line="2162"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2162"></span>s  heart  sickened  at the
        discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the
        stickiness of one<span data-line="2164"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2164"></span>s socks, the lifts  that  never  worked,  the
        cold  water,  the  gritty  soap,  the  cigarettes  that came to
        pieces, the food with its strange evil tastes? Why  should  one
        feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral
        memory that things had once been different?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2170"><span data-line="2170"></span>He  looked  round  the  canteen again. Nearly everyone was
        ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed  otherwise
        than in the uniform blue overalls. On the far side of the room,
        sitting  at  a  table alone, a small, curiously beetle-like man
        was  drinking  a  cup  of  coffee,  his  little  eyes   darting
        suspicious  glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought
        Winston, if you did not look about you,  to  believe  that  the
        physical  type  set  up  by the Party as an ideal-tall muscular
        youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt,
        carefree — existed and even predominated. Actually, so far  as
        he  could  judge,  the  majority of people in Airstrip One were
        small,  dark,  and  ill-favoured.  It  was  curious  how   that
        beetle-like  type  proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy
        men, growing stout very early in life, with short  legs,  swift
        scuttling  movements, and fat inscrutable faces with very small
        eyes. It was the type that seemed to flourish  best  under  the
        dominion of the Party.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2188"><span data-line="2188"></span>The  announcement  from  the  Ministry  of Plenty ended on
        another trumpet call and gave  way  to  tinny  music.  Parsons,
        stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures, took
        his pipe out of his mouth.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2193"><span data-line="2193"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The  Ministry  of Plenty&#39;s certainly done a good job this
        year,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2194"></span> he said with a knowing shake of his head. <span data-line="2194"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">By  the  way,
        Smith  old  boy, I suppose you haven&#39;t got any razor blades you
        can let me have?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2196"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2198"><span data-line="2198"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Not one,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2198"></span> said Winston. <span data-line="2198"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;ve been using the  same  blade
        for six weeks myself.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2199"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2201"><span data-line="2201"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Ah, well — just thought I&#39;d ask you, old boy.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2201"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2203"><span data-line="2203"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Sorry,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2203"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2205"><span data-line="2205"></span>The  quacking  voice  from  the  next  table,  temporarily
        silenced during the Ministry<span data-line="2206"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2206"></span>s  announcement,  had  started  up
        again,  as loud as ever. For some reason Winston suddenly found
        himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her wispy  hair  and  the
        dust  in  the  creases  of  her  face.  Within  two years those
        children would be denouncing her to  the  Thought  Police.  Mrs
        Parsons  would  be  vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. Winston
        would be vaporized. O<span data-line="2212"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2212"></span>Brien would be vaporized. Parsons, on the
        other hand, would never be vaporized. The eyeless creature with
        the  quacking  voice  would  never  be  vaporized.  The  little
        beetle-like  men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine
        corridors of Ministries they, too, would  never  be  vaporized.
        And  the  girl  with  dark  hair,  the  girl  from  the Fiction
        Department — she would never be vaporized either. It seemed to
        him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who  would
        perish:  though just what it was that made for survival, it was
        not easy to say.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2223"><span data-line="2223"></span>At this moment he was dragged out of his  reverie  with  a
        violent  jerk.  The  girl  at  the next table had turned partly
        round and was looking at him. It was the girl with  dark  hair.
        She  was  looking  at  him  in a sidelong way, but with curious
        intensity. The instant she  caught  his  eye  she  looked  away
        again.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2230"><span data-line="2230"></span>The  sweat  started  out on Winston<span data-line="2230"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2230"></span>s backbone. A horrible
        pang of terror went through him. It was gone  almost  at  once,
        but  it  left  a sort of nagging uneasiness behind. Why was she
        watching  him?  Why  did  she   keep   following   him   about?
        Unfortunately  he  could  not  remember whether she had already
        been  at  the  table  when  he  arrived,  or  had  come   there
        afterwards.  But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two Minutes
        Hate, she had sat immediately behind  him  when  there  was  no
        apparent  need  to do so. Quite likely her real object had been
        to listen to him and make sure whether he was  shouting  loudly
        enough.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2242"><span data-line="2242"></span>His  earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not
        actually a member of  the  Thought  Police,  but  then  it  was
        precisely  the  amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all.
        He did not know how long she  had  been  looking  at  him,  but
        perhaps  for  as much as five minutes, and it was possible that
        his features had not  been  perfectly  under  control.  It  was
        terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in
        any  public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest
        thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an  unconscious  look
        of  anxiety,  a habit of muttering to yourself — anything that
        carried with  it  the  suggestion  of  abnormality,  of  having
        something  to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression
        on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced,
        for example) was itself a punishable offence. There was even  a
        word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2258"><span data-line="2258"></span>The  girl  had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after
        all she was not really following  him  about,  perhaps  it  was
        coincidence  that she had sat so close to him two days running.
        His cigarette had gone out, and he laid  it  carefully  on  the
        edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work, if he
        could  keep  the  tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the
        next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely he
        would be in the cellars of the Ministry of  Love  within  three
        days,  but  a cigarette end must not be wasted. Syme had folded
        up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket. Parsons
        had begun talking again.

        the stem of his pipe, <span data-line="2271"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">about the time when those two nippers of
        mine  set fire to the old market-woman&#39;s skirt because they saw
        her wrapping up sausages in a poster of B.B.? Sneaked up behind
        her and set fire to it with a box of matches. Burned her  quite
        badly,  I  believe.  Little  beggars,  eh? But keen as mustard!
        That&#39;s a first-rate  training  they  give  them  in  the  Spies
        nowadays — better than in my day, even. What d&#39;you think&#39;s the
        latest  thing  they&#39;ve  served  them out with? Ear trumpets for
        listening through keyholes! My little girl  brought  one  home
        the  other  night — tried it out on our sitting-room door, and
        reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her  ear  to  the
        hole. Of course it&#39;s only a toy, mind you. Still, gives &#39;em the

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2285"><span data-line="2285"></span>At  this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle.
        It was the signal to return to work. All three  men  sprang  to
        their  feet  to  join  in the struggle round the lifts, and the
        remaining tobacco fell out of Winston<span data-line="2288"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2288"></span>s cigarette.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="2292"><span data-line="2292"></span>Winston was writing in his diary:
</p>
<blockquote data-line="2294">

<p class="p noindent" data-line="2294"><span data-line="2294"></span>It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in  a
        narrow  side-street  near  one of the big railway stations. She
        was standing near a doorway in the wall, under  a  street  lamp
        that  hardly gave any light. She had a young face, painted very
        thick. It was  really  the  paint  that  appealed  to  me,  the
        whiteness  of  it,  like a mask, and the bright red lips. Party
        women never paint their faces. There was  nobody  else  in  the
        street, and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p noindent" data-line="2303"><span data-line="2303"></span>For  the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his
        eyes and pressed his fingers against them,  trying  to  squeeze
        out   the   vision  that  kept  recurring.  He  had  an  almost
        overwhelming temptation to shout a string of  filthy  words  at
        the  top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to
        kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window  —
        to  do  any  violent or noisy or painful thing that might black
        out the memory that was tormenting him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2312"><span data-line="2312"></span>Your worst enemy,  he  reflected,  was  your  own  nervous
        system.  At  any  moment  the  tension inside you was liable to
        translate itself into some visible symptom. He thought of a man
        whom he had passed in the street a  few  weeks  back;  a  quite
        ordinary-looking  man,  a  Party  member,  aged  thirty-five to
        forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They were a few
        metres apart when the left side of the man<span data-line="2318"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2318"></span>s face was  suddenly
        contorted  by  a  sort of spasm. It happened again just as they
        were passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid
        as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual. He
        remembered thinking at the time: That poor devil is  done  for.
        And what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly
        unconscious.  The most deadly danger of all was talking in your
        sleep. There was no way of guarding against that, so far as  he
        could see.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2328"><span data-line="2328"></span>He drew his breath and went on writing:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2330"><span data-line="2330"></span>I  went  with  her  through  the  doorway  and across a
        backyard into a basement kitchen. There was a bed  against  the
        wall, and a lamp on the table, turned down very low. She
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2334"><span data-line="2334"></span>His  teeth  were set on edge. He would have liked to spit.
        Simultaneously with  the  woman  in  the  basement  kitchen  he
        thought of Katharine, his wife. Winston was married — had been
        married,  at any rate: probably he still was married, so far as
        he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to breathe  again  the
        warm  stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded
        of bugs and dirty  clothes  and  villainous  cheap  scent,  but
        nevertheless  alluring, because no woman of the Party ever used
        scent, or could be imagined as doing so. Only the  proles  used
        scent.  In  his  mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up
        with fornication.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2346"><span data-line="2346"></span>When he had gone with that woman it  had  been  his  first
        lapse  in two years or thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes
        was forbidden, of course, but it was one of  those  rules  that
        you   could  occasionally  nerve  yourself  to  break.  It  was
        dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be caught
        with a prostitute might mean  five  years  in  a  forced-labour
        camp:  not  more, if you had committed no other offence. And it
        was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being caught  in
        the  act. The poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready
        to sell themselves. Some could even be purchased for  a  bottle
        of  gin,  which  the proles were not supposed to drink. Tacitly
        the Party was even inclined to encourage  prostitution,  as  an
        outlet  for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed.
        Mere debauchery did not matter very much, so  long  as  it  was
        furtive  and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged
        and despised class.  The  unforgivable  crime  was  promiscuity
        between Party members. But — though this was one of the crimes
        that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to —
        it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2366"><span data-line="2366"></span>The  aim  of  the  Party was not merely to prevent men and
        women from forming loyalties which it  might  not  be  able  to
        control.  Its  real,  undeclared  purpose  was  to  remove  all
        pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much as eroticism was
        the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. All marriages
        between Party  members  had  to  be  approved  by  a  committee
        appointed  for  the  purpose,  and  — though the principle was
        never clearly stated — permission was always  refused  if  the
        couple  concerned  gave  the  impression  of  being  physically
        attracted to  one  another.  The  only  recognized  purpose  of
        marriage  was  to  beget children for the service of the Party.
        Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting
        minor operation, like having an enema. This again was never put
        into plain words, but in an indirect way  it  was  rubbed  into
        every  Party  member  from  childhood  onwards. There were even
        organizations  such  as  the  Junior  Anti-Sex  League,   which
        advocated  complete  celibacy for both sexes. All children were
        to be begotten by artificial  insemination  (artsem,  it
        was  called in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions.
        This, Winston was aware, was not  meant  altogether  seriously,
        but  somehow  it  fitted  in  with  the general ideology of the
        Party. The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it
        could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty  it.  He  did
        not  know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should
        be so. And as far as the  women  were  concerned,  the  Party<span data-line="2390"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2390"></span>s
        efforts were largely successful.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2393"><span data-line="2393"></span>He  thought  again  of  Katharine. It must be nine, ten —
        nearly eleven years since they had parted. It was  curious  how
        seldom  he thought of her. For days at a time he was capable of
        forgetting that he had ever been married. They  had  only  been
        together  for  about  fifteen  months. The Party did not permit
        divorce, but it rather encouraged  separation  in  cases  where
        there were no children.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2401"><span data-line="2401"></span>Katharine  was  a  tall,  fair-haired girl, very straight,
        with splendid movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a  face
        that  one  might  have  called  noble until one discovered that
        there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it.  Very  early
        in  her  married  life  he had decided — though perhaps it was
        only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most  people
        — that  she  had  without  exception  the most stupid, vulgar,
        empty mind that he had ever encountered. She had not a  thought
        in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility,
        absolutely  none  that she was not capable of swallowing if the
        Party  handed  it  out  to  her.  <span data-line="2411"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The  human  sound-track</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2411"></span>  he
        nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he could have endured living
        with her if it had not been for just one thing — sex.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2415"><span data-line="2415"></span>As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen.
        To embrace  her  was like embracing a jointed wooden image. And
        what was strange was  that  even  when  she  was  clasping  him
        against  her  he  had  the  feeling that she was simultaneously
        pushing him away with all her strength.  The  rigidlty  of  her
        muscles  managed to convey that impression. She would lie there
        with  shut  eyes,  neither  resisting  nor   co-operating   but
        submitting.  It  was  extraordinarily embarrassing, and,
        after a while, horrible. But even  then  he  could  have  borne
        living  with  her if it had been agreed that they should remain
        celibate. But curiously enough it  was  Katharine  who  refused
        this.  They  must,  she said, produce a child if they could. So
        the  performance  continued  to  happen,  once  a  week   quite
        regulariy,  whenever  it  was  not impossible. She even used to
        remind him of it in the morning, as something which had  to  be
        done  that evening and which must not be forgotten. She had two
        names for it. One was <span data-line="2431"></span>&#8216;_making a baby&#8217;<span data-line="2431"></span>, and the other  was  <span data-line="2431"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">our
        duty  to  the  Party</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2432"></span> (yes, she had actually used that phrase).
        Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the
        appointed day came round. But luckily no child appeared, and in
        the end she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards  they
        parted.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2438"><span data-line="2438"></span>Winston  sighed  inaudibly. He picked up his pen again and
        wrote:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2441"><span data-line="2441"></span>She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without
        any kind of preliminary in the most coarse,  horrible  way  you
        can imagine, pulled up her skirt. I
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2445"><span data-line="2445"></span>He  saw  himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with
        the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, and  in  his
        heart  a  feeling  of  defeat and resentment which even at that
        moment was mixed up with the thought of Katharine<span data-line="2448"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2448"></span>s white body,
        frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party. Why did  it
        always  have  to be like this? Why could he not have a woman of
        his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years?
        But a real love affair was an  almost  unthinkable  event.  The
        women  of  the  Party  were  all  alike.  Chastity  was as deep
        ingrained  in  them  as  Party  loyalty.   By   careful   early
        conditioning,  by games and cold water, by the rubbish that was
        dinned into them at school and  in  the  Spies  and  the  Youth
        League,  by  lectures,  parades,  songs,  slogans,  and martial
        music, the natural feeling had been driven  out  of  them.  His
        reason  told  him  that there must be exceptions, but his heart
        did not believe it. They were all  impregnable,  as  the  Party
        intended  that  they  should  be. And what he wanted, more even
        than to be loved, was to break down that wall of  virtue,  even
        if  it  were  only  once  in  his  whole  life. The sexual act,
        successfully performed, was rebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime.
        Even to have awakened Katharine, if he could have achieved  it,
        would have been like a seduction, although she was his wife.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2468"><span data-line="2468"></span>But  the  rest of the story had got to be written down. He
        wrote:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2471"><span data-line="2471"></span>I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2473"><span data-line="2473"></span>After the darkness the feeble light of the  paraffin  lamp
        had  seemed  very  bright.  For the first time he could see the
        woman properly. He had  taken  a  step  towards  her  and  then
        halted,  full of lust and terror. He was painfully conscious of
        the risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectly possible
        that the patrols would catch him  on  the  way  out:  for  that
        matter  they  might be waiting outside the door at this moment.
        If he went away without even doing what he had come here to  do
        —<span data-line="2481"></span> <span data-line="2481"></span>!
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2483"><span data-line="2483"></span>It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed.
        What he  had  suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman
        was old. The paint was plastered so thick  on  her  face
        that  it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask.
        There were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly dreadful
        detail was that her mouth had fallen a little  open,  revealing
        nothing except a cavernous blackness. She had no teeth at all.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2491"><span data-line="2491"></span>He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2493"><span data-line="2493"></span>When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman,
        fifty  years old at least. But I went ahead and did it just the
        same.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2497"><span data-line="2497"></span>He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again.  He  had
        written it down at last, but it made no difference. The therapy
        had  not  worked.  The urge to shout filthy words at the top of
        his voice was as strong as ever.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="2504"><span data-line="2504"></span>If there is hope, wrote Winston, it lies in  the
        proles.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2507"><span data-line="2507"></span>If  there  was  hope,  it  must  lie in the proles,
        because only there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 per
        cent of the population of Oceania, could the force  to  destroy
        the  Party ever be generated. The Party could not be overthrown
        from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way  of
        coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if the
        legendary  Brotherhood  existed,  as just possibly it might, it
        was inconceivable that  its  members  could  ever  assemble  in
        larger  numbers than twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in
        the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional
        whispered word. But the proles,  if  only  they  could  somehow
        become  conscious  of their own strength. would have no need to
        conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like
        a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they  could  blow  the
        Party  to  pieces  tomorrow  morning. Surely sooner or later it
        must occur to them to do it? And yet-!
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2524"><span data-line="2524"></span>He remembered how once he had been walking down a  crowded
        street  when  a  tremendous shout of hundreds of voices women<span data-line="2525"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2525"></span>s
        voices — had burst from a side-street a little way  ahead.  It
        was  a  great formidable cry of anger and despair, a deep, loud
        <span data-line="2528"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oh-o-o-o-oh!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2528"></span> that went humming on like the reverberation of a
        bell. His heart had leapt. It<span data-line="2529"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2529"></span>s  started!  he  had  thought.  A
        riot!  The  proles  are  breaking  loose  at  last! When he had
        reached the spot it was to see a mob of two  or  three  hundred
        women  crowding round the stalls of a street market, with faces
        as tragic as though they had been the doomed  passengers  on  a
        sinking ship. But at this moment the general despair broke down
        into  a  multitude of individual quarrels. It appeared that one
        of the  stalls  had  been  selling  tin  saucepans.  They  were
        wretched,  flimsy  things,  but  cooking-pots  of any kind were
        always difficult to get. Now the supply had unexpectedly  given
        out. The successful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were
        trying  to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others
        clamoured  round  the  stall,  accusing  the   stall-keeper   of
        favouritism  and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve.
        There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one  of
        them  with  her  hair  coming  down,  had  got hold of the same
        saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another<span data-line="2545"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2545"></span>s hands.
        For a moment they were both tugging, and then the  handle  came
        off.  Winston  watched  them  disgustedly.  And yet, just for a
        moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in  that  cry
        from  only  a  few hundred throats! Why was it that they could
        never shout like that about anything that mattered?

<p class="p indent" data-line="2558"><span data-line="2558"></span>That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription
        from one of the Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of  course,
        to   have   liberated  the  proles  from  bondage.  Before  the
        Revolution  they  had   been   hideously   oppressed   by   the
        capitalists,  they had been starved and flogged, women had been
        forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work  in  the
        coal  mines,  as a matter of fact), children had been sold into
        the factories at the age of six. But  simultaneously,  true  to
        the Principles of doublethink, the Party taught that the proles
        were  natural  inferiors  who  must be kept in subjection, like
        animals, by the application of a few simple rules.  In  reality
        very little was known about the proles. It was not necessary to
        know  much.  So long as they continued to work and breed, their
        other activities were without importance. Left  to  themselves,
        like cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had
        reverted  to  a  style  of  life that appeared to be natural to
        them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They were born, they grew up
        in the gutters, they  went  to  work  at  twelve,  they  passed
        through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire,
        they  married  at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they
        died, for the most part, at sixty.  Heavy  physical  work,  the
        care  of  home  and  children,  petty quarrels with neighbours,
        films, football, beer, and above all, gambling, filled  up  the
        horizon  of  their  minds.  To  keep  them  in  control was not
        difficult. A few agents of  the  Thought  Police  moved  always
        among  them,  spreading  false  rumours  and  marking  down and
        eliminating the few individuals  who  were  judged  capable  of
        becoming  dangerous;  but  no  attempt was made to indoctrinate
        them with the ideology of the Party. It was not desirable  that
        the  proles should have strong political feelings. All that was
        required of them was a  primitive  patriotism  which  could  be
        appealed  to  whenever  it  was  necessary  to make them accept
        longer working-hours or shorter rations.  And  even  when  they
        became  discontented,  as  they sometimes did, their discontent
        led nowhere, because being without general  ideas,  they  could
        only  focus  it  on petty specific grievances. The larger evils
        invariably escaped their notice. The great majority  of  proles
        did  not  even  have telescreens in their homes. Even the civil
        police interfered with them  very  little.  There  was  a  vast
        amount  of  criminality in London, a whole world-within-a-world
        of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and racketeers
        of every description; but  since  it  all  happened  among  the
        proles themselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of
        morals  they  were  allowed to follow their ancestral code. The
        sexual puritanism of the  Party  was  not  imposed  upon  them.
        Promiscuity  went  unpunished,  divorce was permitted. For that
        matter, even religious worship would have been permitted if the
        proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it.  They  were
        beneath  suspicion.  As  the  Party  slogan put it: <span data-line="2606"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Proles and
        animals are free.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2607"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2609"><span data-line="2609"></span>Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose
        ulcer. It had begun itching again.  The  thing  you  invariably
        came  back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before
        the Revolution had really been like. He took out of the  drawer
        a  copy  of a children<span data-line="2613"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2613"></span>s history textbook which he had borrowed
        from Mrs Parsons, and began copying a passage into the diary:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2616"><span data-line="2616"></span>In the old days (it ran),  before  the  glorious
        Revolution,  London  was  not  the  beautiful city that we know
        today. It was a  dark,  dirty,  miserable  place  where  hardly
        anybody  had  enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of
        poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a  roof  to
        sleep  under.  Children  no  older  than you had to work twelve
        hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them  with  whips  if
        they  worked  too  slowly  and  fed  them  on nothing but stale
        breadcrusts and water.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2626"><span data-line="2626"></span>But in among all this terrible poverty there were  just
        a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men
        who  had  as  many as thirty servants to look after them. These
        rich men were called capitalists. They were fat, ugly men  with
        wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page.
        You  can  see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was
        called a frock coat, and a  queer,  shiny  hat  shaped  like  a
        stovepipe,  which was called a top hat. This was the uniform of
        the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it.
        The capitalists owned everything in  the  world,  and  everyone
        else  was their slave. They owned all the land, all the houses,
        all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed  them
        they  could  throw them into prison, or they could take his job
        away and starve him to death. When any ordinary person spoke to
        a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him, and take off  his
        cap  and address him as <span data-line="2641"></span>&#8216;_Sir&#8217;<span data-line="2641"></span>. The chief of all the capitalists
        was called the King. and
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2644"><span data-line="2644"></span>But he knew the rest of  the  catalogue.  There  would  be
        mention  of  the  bishops  in their lawn sleeves, the judges in
        their ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the
        cat-o<span data-line="2647"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2647"></span>-nine tails, the Lord Mayor<span data-line="2647"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2647"></span>s Banquet, and  the  practice
        of  kissing the Pope<span data-line="2648"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2648"></span>s toe. There was also something called the
        jus primae noctis, which would probably not be mentioned
        in a textbook for children. It  was  the  law  by  which  every
        capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one
        of his factories.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2654"><span data-line="2654"></span>How   could   you  tell  how  much  of  it  was  lies?  It
        might be true that the average human  being  was  better
        off  now  than  he  had  been  before  the Revolution. The only
        evidence to the contrary was  the  mute  protest  in  your  own
        bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in
        were  intolerable  and  that  at some other time they must have
        been different. It struck him  that  the  truly  characteristic
        thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but
        simply  its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. Life, if
        you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the  lies
        that  streamed  out  of the telescreens, but even to the ideals
        that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of  it,  even
        for a Party member, were neutral and non-political, a matter of
        slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube,
        darning  a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a
        cigarette end. The ideal set up  by  the  Party  was  something
        huge,  terrible,  and  glittering  —  a  world  of  steel  and
        concrete, of monstrous machines and  terrifying  weapons  —  a
        nation  of  warriors  and fanatics, marching forward in perfect
        unity, all thinking the same thoughts  and  shouting  the  same
        slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting
        — three  hundred  million  people  all with the same face. The
        reality  was  decaying,  dingy  cities  where  underfed  people
        shuffled   to   and   fro   in   leaky   shoes,  in  patched-up
        nineteenth-century houses that smelt always of cabbage and  bad
        lavatories.  He  seemed  to  see  a  vision of London, vast and
        ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it was a
        picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair,
        fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2684"><span data-line="2684"></span>He reached down and scratched his  ankle  again.  Day  and
        night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving
        that  people  today had more food, more clothes, better houses,
        better recreations — that they lived  longer,  worked  shorter
        hours,   were   bigger,   healthier,  stronger,  happier,  more
        intelligent, better educated, than the people  of  fifty  years
        ago.  Not  a  word of it could ever be proved or disproved. The
        Party claimed, for example, that today 40  per  cent  of  adult
        proles  were  literate: before the Revolution, it was said, the
        number had only been 15 per cent. The Party  claimed  that  the
        infant  mortality  rate  was now only 160 per thousand, whereas
        before the Revolution it had been 300 — and so it went on.  It
        was  like  a  single  equation with two unknowns. It might very
        well be that literally every word in the  history  books,  even
        the  things  that  one  accepted  without  question,  was  pure
        fantasy. For all he knew there might never have been  any  such
        law  as the jus primae noctis, or any such creature as a
        capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2703"><span data-line="2703"></span>Everything faded into  mist.  The  past  was  erased,  the
        erasure  was  forgotten, the lie became truth. Just once in his
        life he had possessed — after the event: that was  what
        counted  —  concrete,  unmistakable  evidence  of  an  act  of
        falsification. He had held it between his fingers for  as  long
        as  thirty  seconds. In 1973, it must have been — at any rate,
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="2711" style="display:block"><code>    it was at about the time when he and Katharine had parted.  But
    the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier.</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="2714"><span data-line="2714"></span>The  story  really began in the middle sixties, the period
        of the great purges  in  which  the  original  leaders  of  the
        Revolution  were  wiped  out  once and for all. By 1970 none of
        them was left, except Big Brother himself. All the rest had  by
        that    time    been   exposed   as   traitors   and   counter-
        revolutionaries. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one  knew
        where,  and  of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while
        the majority had been executed after spectacular public  trials
        at  which  they made confession of their crimes. Among the last
        survivors were three men named Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford.
        It must have been in 1965 that these three had  been  arrested.
        As  often  happened,  they  had vanished for a year or more, so
        that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then
        had suddenly been brought forth to  incriminate  themselves  in
        the  usual  way.  They  had  confessed to intelligence with the
        enemy (at that date, too, the enemy was Eurasia),  embezzlement
        of  public  funds, the murder of various trusted Party members,
        intrigues against the  leadership  of  Big  Brother  which  had
        started  long  before  the  Revolution  happened,  and  acts of
        sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of  people.
        After  confessing  to  these  things  they  had  been pardoned,
        reinstated in the Party, and given posts  which  were  in  fact
        sinecures  but  which  sounded important. All three had written
        long,  abject  articles  in  The  Times,  analysing  the
        reasons for their defection and promising to make amends.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2740"><span data-line="2740"></span>Some  time  after  their release Winston had actually seen
        all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Café. He remembered the
        sort of terrified fascination with which he  had  watched  them
        out  of  the  corner  of  his eye. They were men far older than
        himself, relics of the ancient world,  almost  the  last  great
        figures  left  over  from  the  heroic  days  of the Party. The
        glamour of the underground struggle and  the  civil  war  still
        faintly  clung  to  them. He had the feeling, though already at
        that time facts and dates were  growing  blurry,  that  he  had
        known  their  names years earlier than he had known that of Big
        Brother. But also they  were  outlaws,  enemies,  untouchables,
        doomed  with  absolute certainty to extinction within a year or
        two. No one who had once fallen into the hands of  the  Thought
        Police ever escaped in the end. They were corpses waiting to be
        sent back to the grave.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2756"><span data-line="2756"></span>There  was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It
        was not wise even to be  seen  in  the  neighbourhood  of  such
        people.  They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin
        flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the café. Of
        the  three,  it  was  Rutherford  whose  appearance  had   most
        impressed   Winston.   Rutherford   had   once  been  a  famous
        caricaturist, whose  brutal  cartoons  had  helped  to  inflame
        popular  opinion before and during the Revolution. Even now, at
        long  intervals,  his  cartoons  were   appearing   in   The
        Times. They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner,
        and  curiously  lifeless  and  unconvincing. Always they were a
        rehashing of the ancient themes  —  slum  tenements,  starving
        children,  street  battles,  capitalists in top hats — even on
        the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling  to  their
        top hats an endless, hopeless effort to get back into the past.
        He  was  a  monstrous man, with a mane of greasy grey hair, his
        face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At  one  time
        he  must  have  been  immensely  strong; now his great body was
        sagging, sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction.  He
        seemed  to  be  breaking  up before one<span data-line="2775"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2775"></span>s eyes, like a mountain
        crumbling.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2778"><span data-line="2778"></span>It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could  not  now
        remember how he had come to be in the café at such a time. The
        place  was  almost  empty. A tinny music was trickling from the
        telescreens.  The  three  men  sat  in  their   corner   almost
        motionless,  never  speaking.  Uncommanded,  the waiter brought
        fresh glasses of gin. There  was  a  chessboard  on  the  table
        beside  them,  with the pieces set out but no game started. And
        then, for perhaps half a minute in all, something  happened  to
        the  telescreens.  The tune that they were playing changed, and
        the tone of the music changed too. There came into it — but it
        was something hard to describe. It  was  a  peculiar,  cracked,
        braying,  jeering  note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow
        note. And then a voice from the telescreen was singing:
             Under the spreading chestnut tree
             I sold you and you sold me:
             There lie they, and here lie we
             Under the spreading chestnut tree.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2796"><span data-line="2796"></span>The three men never  stirred.  But  when  Winston  glanced
        again  at  Rutherford<span data-line="2797"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2797"></span>s ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were
        full of tears. And for the first time he noticed, with  a  kind
        of  inward  shudder,  and  yet  not  knowing  at what he
        shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2802"><span data-line="2802"></span>A little later all three  were  re-arrested.  It  appeared
        that  they  had  engaged  in  fresh  conspiracies from the very
        moment of their release. At their second trial  they  confessed
        to  all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new
        ones. They were executed, and their fate was  recorded  in  the
        Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years after
        this,  in  1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which
        had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk  when
        he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped
        in  among  the  others  and  then forgotten. The instant he had
        flattened it out he saw its significance. It  was  a  half-page
        torn  out of The Times of about ten years earlier — the
        top half of the page, so that it included the date  —  and  it
        contained  a photograph of the delegates at some Party function
        in New York. Prominent in the middle of the group  were  Jones,
        Aaronson,  and  Rutherford. There was no mistaking them, in any
        case their names were in the caption at the bottom.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2820"><span data-line="2820"></span>The point was that  at  both  trials  all  three  men  had
        confessed  that  on  that  date they had been on Eurasian soil.
        They had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous
        somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred  with  members  of  the
        Eurasian  General  Staff,  to  whom they had betrayed important
        military secrets.  The  date  had  stuck  in  Winston<span data-line="2825"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2825"></span>s  memory
        because  it  chanced  to  be midsummer day; but the whole story
        must be on record in countless other places as well. There  was
        only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2830"><span data-line="2830"></span>Of  course,  this  was  not in itself a discovery. Even at
        that time Winston had not imagined that  the  people  who  were
        wiped  out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that
        they were accused of. But this was concrete evidence; it was  a
        fragment  of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns
        up in the wrong stratum and destroys a  geological  theory.  It
        was  enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could
        have been published to the  world  and  its  significance  made
        known.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2840"><span data-line="2840"></span>He  had  gone  straight on working. As soon as he saw what
        the photograph was, and what it meant, he  had  covered  it  up
        with  another  sheet of paper. Luckily, when he unrolled it, it
        had been upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2845"><span data-line="2845"></span>He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his
        chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible.
        To keep your face expressionless was not  difficult,  and  even
        your  breathing  could  be  controlled, with an effort: but you
        could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen
        was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let what he  judged
        to  be  ten  minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear
        that some accident — a sudden draught blowing across his desk,
        for instance — would betray him. Then, without  uncovering  it
        again,  he  dropped  the photograph into the memory hole, along
        with some other waste papers. Within another  minute,  perhaps,
        it would have crumbled into ashes.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2858"><span data-line="2858"></span>That  was  ten  —  eleven  years ago. Today, probably, he
        would have kept that photograph. It was curious that  the  fact
        of  having  held  it  in  his  fingers  seemed to him to make a
        difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as the
        event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party<span data-line="2862"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2862"></span>s  hold  upon
        the  past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence
        which existed no longer had once existed?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2866"><span data-line="2866"></span>But today, supposing that it could be somehow  resurrected
        from  its  ashes,  the  photograph  might not even be evidence.
        Already, at the time when he made his discovery, Oceania was no
        longer at war with Eurasia, and it must have been to the agents
        of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country.
        Since then there had been other changes — two, three, he could
        not remember how many. Very likely  the  confessions  had  been
        rewritten  and  rewritten until the original facts and dates no
        longer  had  the  smallest  significance.  The  past  not  only
        changed, but changed continuously. What most afflicted him with
        the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood
        why the huge imposture was undertaken. The immediate advantages
        of  falsifying  the  past were obvious, but the ultimate motive
        was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2881"><span data-line="2881"></span>I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2883"><span data-line="2883"></span>He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether
        he himself was a  lunatic.  Perhaps  a  lunatic  was  simply  a
        minority  of  one. At one time it had been a sign of madness to
        believe that the earth goes round the sun;  today,  to  believe
        that  the  past  is  inalterable.  He  might be alone in
        holding that belief, and if alone,  then  a  lunatic.  But  the
        thought  of  being  a  lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the
        horror was that he might also be wrong.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2892"><span data-line="2892"></span>He picked up the children<span data-line="2892"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2892"></span>s history book and looked at the
        portrait of Big Brother  which  formed  its  frontispiece.  The
        hypnotic  eyes  gazed  into his own. It was as though some huge
        force were pressing down upon you — something that  penetrated
        inside  your  skull,  battering against your brain, frightening
        you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost,  to  deny  the
        evidence  of  your  senses. In the end the Party would announce
        that two and two made five, and you would have to  believe  it.
        It  was  inevitable  that they should make that claim sooner or
        later: the logic of their position demanded it. Not merely  the
        validity  of  experience,  but  the  very existence of external
        reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy  of
        heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that
        they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might
        be  right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make
        four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the  past  is
        unchangeable?  If  both  the  past and the external world exist
        only in the mind, and if the mind itself is  controllable  what
        then?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2912"><span data-line="2912"></span>But  no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own
        accord. The face of O<span data-line="2913"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2913"></span>Brien,  not  called  up  by  any  obvious
        association,  had  floated  into  his  mind. He knew, with more
        certainty than before, that O<span data-line="2915"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2915"></span>Brien was on  his  side.  He  was
        writing the diary for O<span data-line="2916"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2916"></span>Brien — to O<span data-line="2916"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2916"></span>Brien: it was like
        an  interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which
        was addressed to a particular person and took its  colour  from
        that fact.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2921"><span data-line="2921"></span>The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and
        ears.  It  was  their  final, most essential command. His heart
        sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed  against  him,
        the  ease with which any Party intellectual would overthrow him
        in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be  able  to
        understand, much less answer. And yet he was in the right! They
        were  wrong  and  he was right. The obvious, the silly, and the
        true had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold on to that!
        The solid world exists, its laws  do  not  change.  Stones  are
        hard,  water  is  wet,  objects  unsupported  fall  towards the
        earth<span data-line="2931"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2931"></span>s centre. With  the  feeling  that  he  was  speaking  to
        O<span data-line="2932"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2932"></span>Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom,
        he wrote:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2935"><span data-line="2935"></span>Freedom  is  the  freedom to say that two plus two make
        four. If that is granted, all else follows.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="2940"><span data-line="2940"></span>From somewhere at the bottom of a  passage  the  smell  of
        roasting  coffee  —  real  coffee,  not Victory Coffee — came
        floating out into the street. Winston paused involuntarily. For
        perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world  of
        his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut off the smell
        as abruptly as though it had been a sound.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2947"><span data-line="2947"></span>He  had  walked several kilometres over pavements, and his
        varicose ulcer was throbbing. This was the second time in three
        weeks that he had missed an evening at the Community Centre:  a
        rash  act,  since  you could be certain that the number of your
        attendances at the Centre was carefully checked. In principle a
        Party member had no spare time, and was never alone  except  in
        bed.  It  was  assumed that when he was not working, eating, or
        sleeping he would be taking  part  in  some  kind  of  communal
        recreation: to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude,
        even  to  go  for  a  walk  by  yourself,  was  always slightly
        dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak: ownlife,
        it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But this
        evening as he came out of the Ministry  the  balminess  of  the
        April  air  had  tempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he
        had seen it that year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening  at
        the  Centre,  the  boring,  exhausting games, the lectures, the
        creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed  intolerable.  On
        impulse  he  had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered off
        into the labyrinth of London,  first  south,  then  east,  then
        north  again,  losing  himself among unknown streets and hardly
        bothering in which direction he was going.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2969"><span data-line="2969"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">If there is hope,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2969"></span> he had written in the diary, <span data-line="2969"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">it  lies
        in the proles.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2970"></span> The words kept coming back to him, statement of
        a  mystical truth and a palpable absurdity. He was somewhere in
        the vague, brown-coloured slums to the north and east  of  what
        had  once  been  Saint  Pancras  Station.  He  was walking up a
        cobbled  street  of  little  two-storey  houses  with  battered
        doorways  which  gave  straight  on the pavement and which were
        somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes. There were puddles of
        filthy water here and there among the cobbles. In  and  out  of
        the dark doorways, and down narrow alley-ways that branched off
        on  either side, people swarmed in astonishing numbers — girls
        in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths, and  youths  who
        chased  the  girls,  and  swollen waddling women who showed you
        what the girls would be like in ten years<span data-line="2982"></span>_<span data-line="2982"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2982"></span> time, and  old  bent
        creatures   shuffling   along   on  splayed  feet,  and  ragged
        barefooted  children  who  played  in  the  puddles  and   then
        scattered  at angry yells from their mothers. Perhaps a quarter
        of the windows in the street were broken and boarded  up.  Most
        of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with
        a sort of guarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red
        forearms  folded  across  thelr  aprons  were talking outside a
        doorway.  Winston  caught  scraps   of   conversation   as   he
        approached.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2993"><span data-line="2993"></span>&#8216;_  &#8220;Yes,&#8221;  I  says to &#8217;<span data-line="2993"></span><em class="em-low1">er, &#8220;that&#39;s all very well,&#8221; I says.
        &#8220;But if you&#39;d of been in my place you&#39;d of  done  the  same  as
        what  I  done.  It&#39;s easy to criticize,&#8221; I says, &#8220;but you ain&#39;t
        got the same problems as what I got.&#8221; &#39;</em><span data-line="2996"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="2998"><span data-line="2998"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Ah,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2998"></span> said the other, <span data-line="2998"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">that&#39;s jest it. That&#39;s  jest  where
        it is.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="2999"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3001"><span data-line="3001"></span>The  strident  voices  stopped abruptly. The women studied
        him in hostile  silence  as  he  went  past.  But  it  was  not
        hostility,  exactly;  merely  a  kind  of wariness, a momentary
        stiffening, as at the passing of some  unfamiliar  animal.  The
        blue  overalls  of  the  Party could not be a common sight in a
        street like this. Indeed, it was unwise  to  be  seen  in  such
        places,  unless  you  had  definite business there. The patrols
        might stop you if you happened to run into  them.  <span data-line="3008"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">May  I  see
        your  papers,  comrade?  What are you doing here? What time did
        you leave work? Is this your usual way home?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3010"></span> — and so on  and
        so  forth.  Not that there was any rule against walking home by
        an unusual route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if
        the Thought Police heard about it.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3015"><span data-line="3015"></span>Suddenly the whole street was  in  commotion.  There  were
        yells  of warning from all sides. People were shooting into the
        doorways like rabbits. A young woman leapt out of a  doorway  a
        little  ahead  of Winston, grabbed up a tiny child playing in a
        puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back  again,  all
        in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like
        black  suit,  who  had  emerged  from a side alley, ran towards
        Winston, pointing excitedly to the sky.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3024"><span data-line="3024"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Steamer!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3024"></span> he yelled. <span data-line="3024"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Look out, guv&#39;nor!  Bang  over&#39;ead!
        Lay down quick!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3025"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3027"><span data-line="3027"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Steamer</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3027"></span>  was  a  nickname  which,  for  some reason, the
        proles applied to rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung  himself
        on his face. The proles were nearly always right when they gave
        you a warning of this kind. They seemed to possess some kind of
        instinct  which  told  them  several  seconds in advance when a
        rocket was coming, although the  rockets  supposedly  travelled
        faster than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head.
        There  was  a  roar  that  seemed to make the pavement heave; a
        shower of light objects pattered on to his back. When he  stood
        up  he  found  that he was covered with fragments of glass from
        the nearest window.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3039"><span data-line="3039"></span>He walked on. The bomb had demolished a  group  of  houses
        200  metres  up  the street. A black plume of smoke hung in the
        sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd  was
        already  forming  around  the ruins. There was a little pile of
        plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in  the  middle
        of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he
        saw  that  it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from
        the bloody stump, the hand was so  completely  whitened  as  to
        resemble a plaster cast.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3049"><span data-line="3049"></span>He  kicked  the  thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid
        the crowd, turned down a side-street to the right. Within three
        or four minutes he was out of  the  area  which  the  bomb  had
        affected, and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going
        on  as though nothing had happened. It was nearly twenty hours,
        and the drinking-shops which  the  proles  frequented  (<span data-line="3054"></span>&#8216;pubs&#8217;<span data-line="3054"></span>,
        they  called them) were choked with customers. From their grimy
        swing doors, endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a
        smell of urine, sawdust, and sour beer. In an angle formed by a
        projecting house-front three  men  were  standing  very  close
        together,  the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaper
        which the other two  were  studying  over  his  shoulder.  Even
        before  he  was near enough to make out the expression on their
        faces, Winston could see absorption  in  every  line  of  their
        bodies.  It  was obviously some serious piece of news that they
        were reading. He was a few paces away from them  when  suddenly
        the  group  broke  up  and  two  of  the  men  were  in violent
        altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on  the  point  of
        blows.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3069"><span data-line="3069"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Can&#39;t  you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3088"><span data-line="3088"></span>They  were  talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back
        when he had gone thirty metres. They were still  arguing,  with
        vivid,  passionate  faces. The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out
        of enormous prizes, was the  one  public  event  to  which  the
        proles  paid serious attention. It was probable that there were
        some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the  principal
        if  not  the  only  reason  for  remaining  alive. It was their
        delight,  their  folly,  their  anodyne,   their   intellectual
        stimulant.  Where  the  Lottery  was concerned, even people who
        could  barely  read  and  write  seemed  capable  of  intricate
        calculations  and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole
        tribe of men who made  a  living  simply  by  selling  systems,
        forecasts,  and  lucky  amulets. Winston had nothing to do with
        the running of the Lottery, which was managed by  the  Ministry
        of  Plenty,  but he was aware (indeed everyone in the party was
        aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary. Only small  sums
        were  actually  paid  out,  the winners of the big prizes being
        non-existent   persons.   In   the   absence   of   any    real
        intercommunication  between  one  part  of Oceania and another,
        this was not difficult to arrange.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3109"><span data-line="3109"></span>But if there was hope, it lay in the proles.  You  had  to
        cling  on  to  that.  When  you  put  it  in  words  it sounded
        reasonable: it was when you looked at the human beings  passing
        you  on the pavement that it became an act of faith. The street
        into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that he
        had been in this neighbourhood before, and  that  there  was  a
        main thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came
        a din of shouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then
        ended  in  a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley
        where a few stall-keepers were selling tired-looking vegetables.
        At this moment Winston remembered where he was. The  alley  led
        out  into  the main street, and down the next turning, not five
        minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought  the  blank
        book  which  was now his diary. And in a small stationer<span data-line="3122"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3122"></span>s shop
        not far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3125"><span data-line="3125"></span>He paused for a moment at the top of  the  steps.  On  the
        opposite  side  of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose
        windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were  merely
        coated  with  dust. A very old man, bent but active, with white
        moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn,  pushed
        open  the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, it
        occurred to him that the old man, who must  be  eighty  at  the
        least,  had  already  been  middle-aged  when  the Revolution
        happened. He and a few others like him were the last links that
        now existed with the vanished world of capitalism. In the Party
        itself there were not many people left  whose  ideas  had  been
        formed  before  the Revolution. The older generation had mostly
        been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and  sixties,
        and  the  few  who  survived  had  long ago been terrified into
        complete intellectual surrender. If there  was  any  one  still
        alive  who  could  give you a truthful account of conditions in
        the early part of the  century,  it  could  only  be  a  prole.
        Suddenly  the  passage from the history book that he had copied
        into his diary came back into Winston<span data-line="3143"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3143"></span>s  mind,  and  a  lunatic
        impulse  took  hold  of him. He would go into the pub, he would
        scrape acquaintance with that old  man  and  question  him.  He
        would say to him: <span data-line="3146"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Tell me about your life when you were a boy.
        What  was  it  like in those days? Were things better than they
        are now, or were they worse?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3148"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3150"><span data-line="3150"></span>Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become  frightened,
        he  descended  the  steps and crossed the narrow street. It was
        madness of course. As usual, there was no definite rule against
        talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but  it  was  far
        too  unusual  an  action  to  pass  unnoticed.  If  the patrols
        appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was  not
        likely  that  they  would believe him. He pushed open the door,
        and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. As
        he entered the din of voices dropped to about half its  volume.
        Behind  his  back  he  could  feel  everyone  eyeing  his  blue
        overalls. A game of darts which was going on at the  other  end
        of  the  room  interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty
        seconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing  at  the
        bar,  having some kind of altercation with the barman, a large,
        stout, hook-nosed young man with enormous forearms. A  knot  of
        others,  standing  round  with  glasses  in  their  hands, were
        watching the scene.

<p class="p indent" data-line="3168"><span data-line="3168"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I arst you civil enough, didn&#39;t I?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3168"></span>  said  the  old  man,
        straightening  his  shoulders pugnaciously. <span data-line="3169"></span>&#8216;_You telling me you

<p class="p indent" data-line="3172"><span data-line="3172"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And what in hell&#39;s name is  a  pint?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3172"></span>  said  the  barman,
        leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter.

        half  litre  — that<span data-line="3180"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3180"></span>s all we serve. There<span data-line="3180"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3180"></span>s the glasses on the

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3187"><span data-line="3187"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">When  you  were  a  young  man  we were all living in the
        treetops,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3188"></span>  said  the  barman,  with  a  glance  at  the  other
        customers.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3191"><span data-line="3191"></span>There  was  a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused
        by  Winston<span data-line="3192"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3192"></span>s  entry  seemed  to  disappear.  The   old   man<span data-line="3192"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3192"></span>s
        whitestubbled  face had flushed pink. He turned away, muttering
        to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught him  gently
        by the arm.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3197"><span data-line="3197"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">May I offer you a drink?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3197"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3199"><span data-line="3199"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You&#39;re   a  gent,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3199"></span>  said  the  other,  straightening  his
        shoulders again. He appeared not to have noticed Winston<span data-line="3200"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3200"></span>s blue
        overalls. <span data-line="3201"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Pint!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3201"></span> he added aggressively to the barman. <span data-line="3201"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Pint of
        wallop.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3202"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3204"><span data-line="3204"></span>The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into
        thick glasses which  he  had  rinsed  in  a  bucket  under  the
        counter.  Beer  was the only drink you could get in prole pubs.
        The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though  in  practice
        they  could get hold of it easily enough. The game of darts was
        in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar  had  begun
        talking about lottery tickets. Winston<span data-line="3210"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3210"></span>s presence was forgotten
        for  a moment. There was a deal table under the window where he
        and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard.  It
        was horribly dangerous, but at any rate there was no telescreen
        in the room, a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3216"><span data-line="3216"></span>&quot;<span data-line="3216"></span>E could <span data-line="3216"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">a drawed me off a pint,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3216"></span> grumbled the old man as
        he settled  down behind a glass. <span data-line="3217"></span>&#8216;_A &#8217;<span data-line="3217"></span>_<span data-line="3217"></span>alf litre ain<span data-line="3217"></span>&#8216;t enough. It
        don&#39;t satisfy. And a  &#8217;<span data-line="3218"></span><em class="em-low1">ole  litre&#39;s  too  much.  It  starts  my
        bladder running. Let alone the price.</em><span data-line="3219"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3219"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3221"><span data-line="3221"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  must  have seen great changes since you were a young
        man,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3222"></span> said Winston tentatively.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3224"><span data-line="3224"></span>The old man<span data-line="3224"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3224"></span>s pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to
        the bar, and from the bar to the door of the Gents,  as  though
        it  were  in  the bar-room that he expected the changes to have
        occurred.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3229"><span data-line="3229"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The beer was better,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3229"></span> he said finally. <span data-line="3229"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And cheaper! When
        I was a young man, mild beer — wallop we used to  call  it  —
        was fourpence a pint. That was before the war, of course.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3231"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3233"><span data-line="3233"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Which war was that?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3233"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3235"><span data-line="3235"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s  all wars,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3235"></span> said the old man vaguely. He took up his
        glass, and his shoulders straightened again. <span data-line="3236"></span>&quot;<span data-line="3236"></span>Ere<span data-line="3236"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3236"></span>s wishing you
        the very best of <span data-line="3237"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">ealth!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3237"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3239"><span data-line="3239"></span>In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam<span data-line="3239"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3239"></span>s apple  made  a
        surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished.
        Winston   went   to  the  bar  and  came  back  with  two  more
        half-litres.  The  old  man  appeared  to  have  forgotten  his
        prejudice against drinking a full litre.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3245"><span data-line="3245"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  are  very  much older than I am,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3245"></span> said Winston. <span data-line="3245"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You
        must have been a grown man before I was born. You can  remember
        what it was like in the old days, before the Revolution. People
        of  my age don&#39;t really know anything about those times. We can
        only read about them in books, and what it says  in  the  books
        may  not  be  true.  I  should  like  your opinion on that. The
        history  books  say  that  life  before  the   Revolution   was
        completely  different  from  what it is now. There was the most
        terrible oppression, injustice, poverty worse than anything  we
        can imagine. Here in London, the great mass of the people never
        had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of them hadn&#39;t even
        boots  on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they left
        school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same  time
        there  were  a  very  few  people,  only a few thousands — the
        capitalists, they were called — who were  rich  and  powerful.
        They  owned  everything  that  there  was to own. They lived in
        great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they rode about  in
        motor-cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne, they
        wore top hats-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3263"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3265"><span data-line="3265"></span>The old man brightened suddenly.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3267"><span data-line="3267"></span>&#8216;_Top  &#8217;<span data-line="3267"></span><em class="em-low1">ats!</em><span data-line="3267"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3267"></span>  he  said. <span data-line="3267"></span>&#8216;_Funny you should mention &#39;em. The
        same thing come into my &#8217;<span data-line="3268"></span>_<span data-line="3268"></span>ead only yesterday, I dono why. I  was
        jest thinking, I ain<span data-line="3269"></span>&#8216;t seen a top &#8217;<span data-line="3269"></span>_<span data-line="3269"></span>at in years. Gorn right out,
        they  <span data-line="3270"></span>&#8216;ave.  The last time I wore one was at my sister-in-law&#39;s
        funeral. And that was — well, I couldn&#39;t give  you  the  date,
        but it must&#39;a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only &#8217;<span data-line="3272"></span><em class="em-low1">ired
        for the occasion, you understand.</em><span data-line="3273"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3273"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3275"><span data-line="3275"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It isn&#39;t very important about the top hats,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3275"></span> said Winston
        patiently.  <span data-line="3276"></span>&#8216;_The  point is, these capitalists — they and a few
        lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them — were  the
        lords  of  the earth. Everything existed for their benefit. You
        — the ordinary people, the workers — were their slaves.  They
        could  do  what they liked with you. They could ship you off to
        Canada like cattle. They could sleep  with  your  daughters  if
        they  chose.  They could order you to be flogged with something
        called a cat-o&#8217;<span data-line="3283"></span>-nine tails. You had to take your cap  off  when
        you  passed  them.  Every  capitalist went about with a gang of
        lackeys who-<span data-line="3285"></span>_<span data-line="3285"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3285"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3287"><span data-line="3287"></span>The old man brightened again.

        does. I recollect oh, donkey&#39;s years ago — I used to sometimes
        go to &#8217;<span data-line="3292"></span>_<span data-line="3292"></span>Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to <span data-line="3292"></span>&#8216;_ear the blokes making
        speeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews, Indians — all
        sorts there was. And there was one bloke —  well,  I  couldn&#39;t
        give  you  &#8217;<span data-line="3295"></span>_<span data-line="3295"></span>is  name,  but  a  real powerful speaker <span data-line="3295"></span>&#8216;_e was. &#8217;<span data-line="3295"></span>_<span data-line="3295"></span>E

        bourgeoisie!  Flunkies  of the ruling class!&#8221;<span data-line="3297"></span> Parasites — that
        was another of them. And <span data-line="3298"></span>&#8216;_yenas —  &#8217;<span data-line="3298"></span>_<span data-line="3298"></span>e  definitely  called  <span data-line="3298"></span>&#8216;em

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3302"><span data-line="3302"></span>Winston  had  the  feeling  that  they  were  talking   at
        cross-purposes.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3305"><span data-line="3305"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What  I really wanted to know was this,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3305"></span> he said. <span data-line="3305"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do you
        feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those days?
        Are you treated more like a human being? In the old  days,  the

</p>

<p class="p indent" data-line="3312"><span data-line="3312"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The  House  of  Lords,  if you like. What I am asking is,
        were these people able to treat  you  as  an  inferior,  simply
        because  they  were  rich  and you were poor? Is it a fact, for
        instance, that you had to call them &#8220;Sir&#8221; and take off your cap
        when you passed them?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3316"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3318"><span data-line="3318"></span>The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off about a
        quarter of his beer before answering.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3321"><span data-line="3321"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3321"></span> he said. <span data-line="3321"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They liked you to touch your cap to  &#39;em.
        It  showed respect, like. I didn&#39;t agree with it, myself, but I
        done it often enough. Had to, as you might say.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3323"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3325"><span data-line="3325"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And was it usual — I&#39;m only quoting what  I&#39;ve  read  in

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3329"><span data-line="3329"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">One of  &#39;em  pushed  me  once,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3329"></span>  said  the  old  man.  <span data-line="3329"></span>&#8216;_I
        recollect  it as if it was yesterday. It was Boat Race night —
        terribly rowdy they used to get on Boat Race  night  —  and  I
        bumps  into  a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue. Quite a gent,

        zig-zagging   across   the  pavement,  and  I  bumps  into  <span data-line="3334"></span>&#8216;_im
        accidental-like. &#8217;<span data-line="3335"></span>_<span data-line="3335"></span>E says, <span data-line="3335"></span>&#8220;Why  can&#39;t  you  look  where  you&#39;re

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3344"><span data-line="3344"></span>A sense of helplessness took  hold  of  Winston.  The  old
        man<span data-line="3345"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3345"></span>s  memory  was  nothing  but a rubbish-heap of details. One
        could  question  him  all  day   without   getting   any   real
        information.  The  party histories might still be true, after a
        fashion: they might even be completely true.  He  made  a  last
        attempt.

<p class="p indent" data-line="3351"><span data-line="3351"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Perhaps I have not made myself clear,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3351"></span> he said. <span data-line="3351"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What I&#39;m

        instance,  you  were  already grown up. Would you say from what
        you can remember, that life in 1925 was better than it is  now,
        or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to live then or
        now?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3357"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3359"><span data-line="3359"></span>The  old  man  looked  meditatively at the darts board. He
        finished up his beer, more slowly than before. When he spoke it
        was with a tolerant philosophical air, as though the  beer  had
        mellowed him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3364"><span data-line="3364"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  know  what you expect me to say,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3364"></span> he said. <span data-line="3364"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You expect
        me to say as I&#39;d sooner  be  young  again.  Most  people&#39;d  say
        they&#39;d  sooner  be young, if you arst</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3366"></span> <span data-line="3366"></span>&#8216;em. You got your &#8217;<span data-line="3366"></span>_<span data-line="3366"></span>ealth
        and strength when you<span data-line="3367"></span>&#8216;re young. When you get to my time of life
        you ain&#39;t never well. I suffer something wicked from  my  feet,
        and  my bladder&#39;s jest terrible. Six and seven times a night it
        &#8217;<span data-line="3370"></span>_<span data-line="3370"></span>as me out of bed. On the other <span data-line="3370"></span>&#8216;_and, there&#39;s great  advantages
        in  being  a  old man. You ain&#39;t got the same worries. No truck
        with women, and that&#39;s a great thing. I ain&#39;t &#8217;<span data-line="3372"></span><em class="em-low1">ad a  woman  for
        near  on thirty year, if you&#39;d credit it. Nor wanted to, what&#39;s
        more.</em><span data-line="3374"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3374"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3376"><span data-line="3376"></span>Winston sat back against the window-sill. It  was  no  use
        going  on.  He was about to buy some more beer when the old man
        suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the  stinking  urinal
        at  the  side  of  the  room.  The extra half-litre was already
        working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two gazing  at  his
        empty  glass,  and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out
        into the street again. Within twenty  years  at  the  most,  he
        reflected,  the  huge  and  simple  question,  <span data-line="3383"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Was life better
        before the Revolution than it is now?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3384"></span> would have  ceased  once
        and for all to be answerable. But in effect it was unanswerable
        even  now,  since  the few scattered survivors from the ancient
        world were incapable of comparing one age  with  another.  They
        remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate,
        a  hunt  for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead
        sister<span data-line="3390"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3390"></span>s face, the swirls of dust on a  windy  morning  seventy
        years ago: but all the relevant facts were outside the range of
        their  vision.  They  were  like  the  ant, which can see small
        objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and  written
        records  were falsified — when that happened, the claim of the
        Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got  to
        be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could
        exist, any standard against which it could be tested.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3399"><span data-line="3399"></span>At  this  moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He
        halted and looked up. He was in a narrow  street,  with  a  few
        dark   little   shops,   interspersed   among  dwelling-houses.
        Immediately above his head there hung three  discoloured  metal
        balls  which  looked as if they had once been gilded. He seemed
        to know the place. Of  course!  He  was  standing  outside  the
        junk-shop where he had bought the diary.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3407"><span data-line="3407"></span>A  twinge  of  fear  went  through  him.  It  had  been  a
        sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and  he
        had  sworn  never  to  come  near  the place again. And yet the
        instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander,  his  feet  had
        brought  him  back  here  of their own accord. It was precisely
        against suicidal impulses of this kind that  he  had  hoped  to
        guard himself by opening the diary. At the same time he noticed
        that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still
        open. With the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside
        than  hanging  about  on  the  pavement, he stepped through the
        doorway. If questioned, he could  plausibly  say  that  he  was
        trying to buy razor blades.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3420"><span data-line="3420"></span>The  proprietor  had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which
        gave off an unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps
        sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and  mild
        eyes  distorted by thick spectacles. His hair was almost white,
        but his eyebrows were bushy and still  black.  His  spectacles,
        his  gentle,  fussy movements, and the fact that he was wearing
        an aged jacket of  black  velvet,  gave  him  a  vague  air  of
        intellectuality,  as  though  he had been some kind of literary
        man, or perhaps a musician.  His  voice  was  soft,  as  though
        faded, and his accent less debased than that of the majority of
        proles.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3432"><span data-line="3432"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  recognized  you on the pavement,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3432"></span> he said immediately.
        <span data-line="3433"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You&#39;re the gentleman that bought  the  young  lady&#39;s  keepsake
        album.  That  was  a  beautiful  bit of paper, that was. Cream-
        laid, it used to be called. There&#39;s been  no  paper  like  that
        made  for  — oh, I dare say fifty years.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3436"></span> He peered at Winston
        over the top of his spectacles. <span data-line="3437"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Is there  anything  special  I
        can do for you? Or did you just want to look round?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3438"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3440"><span data-line="3440"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  was passing,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3440"></span> said Winston vaguely. <span data-line="3440"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I just looked in.
        I don&#39;t want anything in particular.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3441"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3443"><span data-line="3443"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s just as well,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3443"></span> said  the  other,  <span data-line="3443"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">because  I  don&#39;t
        suppose  I  could  have  satisfied  you.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3444"></span> He made an apologetic
        gesture with his softpalmed hand. <span data-line="3445"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You see how it is; an  empty
        shop,  you  might  say. Between you and me, the antique trade&#39;s
        just about finished. No demand any longer, and no stock either.
        Furniture, china, glass it&#39;s all been broken up by degrees. And
        of course the metal stuff&#39;s mostly been melted down. I  haven&#39;t
        seen a brass candlestick in years.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3450"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3452"><span data-line="3452"></span>The  tiny  interior  of the shop was in fact uncomfortably
        full, but there was almost  nothing  in  it  of  the  slightest
        value.  The  floorspace  was very restricted, because all round
        the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture-frames. In the
        window there were trays of nuts and  bolts,  worn-out  chisels,
        penknives  with  broken  blades, tarnished watches that did not
        even pretend to be in  going  order,  and  other  miscellaneous
        rubbish. Only on a small table in the corner was there a litter
        of  odds  and ends — lacquered snuffboxes, agate brooches, and
        the like — which looked as though they might include something
        interesting. As Winston wandered towards the table his eye  was
        caught  by  a  round,  smooth  thing that gleamed softly in the
        lamplight, and he picked it up.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3466"><span data-line="3466"></span>It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat  on
        the  other,  making  almost  a hemisphere. There was a peculiar
        softness, as of rainwater, in both the colour and  the  texture
        of  the  glass.  At  the  heart  of it, magnified by the curved
        surface, there was a  strange,  pink,  convoluted  object  that
        recalled a rose or a sea anemone.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3473"><span data-line="3473"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What is it?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3473"></span> said Winston, fascinated.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3475"><span data-line="3475"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That&#39;s  coral,  that is,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3475"></span> said the old man. <span data-line="3475"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It must have
        come from the Indian Ocean. They used to kind of  embed  it  in
        the  glass.  That  wasn&#39;t  made  less than a hundred years ago.
        More, by the look of it.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3478"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3480"><span data-line="3480"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s a beautiful thing,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3480"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3482"><span data-line="3482"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It is a beautiful thing,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3482"></span> said the other  appreciatively.
        <span data-line="3483"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But  there&#39;s  not  many  that&#39;d  say so nowadays.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3483"></span> He coughed.
        <span data-line="3484"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Now, if it so happened that you wanted to buy it, that&#39;d  cost
        you  four  dollars. I can remember when a thing like that would
        have fetched eight pounds, and eight  pounds  was  —  well,  I
        can&#39;t  work  it  out,  but it was a lot of money. But who cares
        about genuine antiques nowadays even the few that&#39;s left?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3488"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3490"><span data-line="3490"></span>Winston immediately paid over the four  dollars  and  slid
        the  coveted  thing into his pocket. What appealed to him about
        it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed  to  possess
        of  belonging  to  an age quite different from the present one.
        The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass that  he  had
        ever  seen.  The  thing  was  doubly  attractive because of its
        apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it  must  once
        have  been  intended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his
        pocket, but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge. It was
        a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a Party member to
        have in his possession.  Anything  old,  and  for  that  matter
        anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man had
        grown   noticeably  more  cheerful  after  receiving  the  four
        dollars. Winston realized that he would have accepted three  or
        even two.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3506"><span data-line="3506"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There&#39;s another room upstairs that you might care to take
        a look  at,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3507"></span>  he  said.  <span data-line="3507"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There&#39;s  not  much  in it. Just a few
        pieces. We&#39;ll do with a light if we&#39;re going upstairs.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3508"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3510"><span data-line="3510"></span>He lit another lamp, and, with bowed  back,  led  the  way
        slowly  up  the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage,
        into a room which did not give on the street but looked out  on
        a  cobbled  yard  and a forest of chimney-pots. Winston noticed
        that the furniture was still arranged as though the  room  were
        meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on the floor,
        a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly arm-chair
        drawn  up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned glass clock with a
        twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the
        window, and occupying nearly a quarter  of  the  room,  was  an
        enormous bed with the mattress still on it.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3522"><span data-line="3522"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We  lived  here till my wife died,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3522"></span> said the old man half
        apologetically. <span data-line="3523"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3523"></span>_<span data-line="3523"></span>I<span data-line="3523"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3523"></span>m selling the furniture off  by  little  and
        little.  Now  that<span data-line="3524"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3524"></span>s  a  beautiful mahogany bed, or at least it
        would be if you could get the bugs out of it. But  I  dare  say
        you<span data-line="3526"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3526"></span>d find it a little bit cumbersome.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3528"><span data-line="3528"></span>He  was  holdlng the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the
        whole room,  and  in  the  warm  dim  light  the  place  looked
        curiously  inviting. The thought flitted through Winston<span data-line="3530"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3530"></span>s mind
        that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few
        dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It  was  a  wild,
        impossible  notion,  to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but
        the room had awakened in him a sort of  nostalgia,  a  sort  of
        ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it
        felt like to sit in a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an
        open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob;
        utterly  alone,  utterly  secure,  with nobody watching you, no
        voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of  the  kettle
        and the friendly ticking of the clock.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3542"><span data-line="3542"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There&#39;s no telescreen!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3542"></span> he could not help murmuring.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3544"><span data-line="3544"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Ah,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3544"></span>  said the old man, <span data-line="3544"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I never had one of those things.
        Too expensive. And I never seemed  to  feel  the  need  of  it,
        somehow.  Now  that&#39;s a nice gateleg table in the corner there.
        Though of course you&#39;d have to put new  hinges  on  it  if  you
        wanted to use the flaps.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3548"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3550"><span data-line="3550"></span>There  was  a  small  bookcase  in  the  other corner, and
        Winston had already gravitated towards it. It contained nothing
        but rubbish. The hunting-down and destruction of books had been
        done with the  same  thoroughness  in  the  prole  quarters  as
        everywhere  else.  It  was  very  unlikely  that  there existed
        anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960.
        The old man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front  of
        a  picture  in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of
        the fireplace, opposite the bed.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3560"><span data-line="3560"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at  all
        -</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3561"></span> he began delicately.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3563"><span data-line="3563"></span>Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel
        engraving  of  an oval building with rectangular windows, and a
        small tower in front. There was a  railing  running  round  the
        building,  and  at the rear end there was what appeared to be a
        statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It seemed vaguely
        familiar, though he did not remember the statue.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3570"><span data-line="3570"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The frame&#39;s fixed to the wall,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3570"></span> said the old man, <span data-line="3570"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">but  I
        could unscrew it for you, I dare say.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3571"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3573"><span data-line="3573"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I know that building,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3573"></span> said Winston finally. <span data-line="3573"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s a ruin
        now. It&#39;s  in  the  middle  of the street outside the Palace of
        Justice.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3575"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3577"><span data-line="3577"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That&#39;s right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in —
        oh, many years ago. It was a church at  one  time,  St  Clement&#39;s
        Danes,  its  name  was.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3579"></span>  He  smiled  apologetically, as though
        conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous,  and  added:
        <span data-line="3581"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement&#39;s!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3581"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3583"><span data-line="3583"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What&#39;s that?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3583"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3585"><span data-line="3585"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oh-&#8220;Oranges  and  lemons, say the bells of St Clement&#39;s.&#8221;
        That was a rhyme we had when I was a little boy. How it goes on
        I don&#39;t remember, but I do know it  ended  up,  &#8220;Here  comes  a
        candle  to  light  you to bed, Here comes a chopper to chop off
        your head.&#8221; It was a kind of a dance. They held out their  arms
        for  you  to  pass  under,  and when they came to &#8220;Here comes a
        chopper to chop off your head&#8221; they brought their arms down and
        caught you. It was just  names  of  churches.  All  the  London
        churches were in it — all the principal ones, that is.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3593"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3595"><span data-line="3595"></span>Winston  wondered  vaguely  to  what  century  the  church
        belonged. It was always difficult to determine  the  age  of  a
        London  building.  Anything  large  and  impressive,  if it was
        reasonably new in  appearance,  was  automatically  claimed  as
        having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was
        obviously  of  earlier  date  was  ascribed  to some dim period
        called the Middle Ages. The centuries of capitalism  were  held
        to  have  produced  nothing  of  any value. One could not learn
        history from architecture any more than one could learn it from
        books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial  stones,  the  names  of
        streets  —  anything  that might throw light upon the past had
        been systematically altered.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3608"><span data-line="3608"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I never knew it had been a church,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3608"></span> he said.
</p>

<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="3617"><span data-line="3617"></span>— <span data-line="3617"></span>&quot;<span data-line="3617"></span>there, now, that<span data-line="3617"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3617"></span>s as far as I can get.
             A  farthing, that was a small copper coin,

<p class="p indent" data-line="3623"><span data-line="3623"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">St Martin&#39;s ? That&#39;s  still  standing.  It&#39;s  in  Victory
        Square,  alongside  the picture gallery. A building with a kind
        of a triangular porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of
        steps.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3626"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3628"><span data-line="3628"></span>Winston knew the place well. It  was  a  museum  used  for
        propaganda  displays of various kinds — scale models of rocket
        bombs and Floating Fortresses,  waxwork  tableaux  illustrating
        enemy atrocities, and the like.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3633"><span data-line="3633"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">St   Martin&#39;s-in-the-Fields   it   used  to  be  called,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3633"></span>
        supplemented the old man, <span data-line="3634"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">though I don&#39;t recollect any  fields
        anywhere in those parts.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3635"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3637"><span data-line="3637"></span>Winston  did  not  buy  the picture. It would have been an
        even more incongruous possession than  the  glass  paperweight,
        and  impossible  to carry home, unless it were taken out of its
        frame. But he lingered for some minutes more,  talking  to  the
        old  man, whose name, he discovered, was not Weeks-as one might
        have gathered from the inscription over the shop-front —  but
        Charrington.  Mr  Charrington,  it  seemed,  was a widower aged
        sixty-three and had  inhabited  this  shop  for  thirty  years.
        Throughout  that  time  he had been intending to alter the name
        over the window, but had never quite got to the point of  doing
        it.  All  the  while that they were talking the half-remembered
        rhyme kept running through Winston<span data-line="3648"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3648"></span>s head. Oranges  and  lemons
        say  the bells of St Clement<span data-line="3649"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3649"></span>s, You owe me three farthings, say
        the bells of St Martin<span data-line="3650"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3650"></span>s! It was curious, but when you said it
        to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the
        bells of a lost London that still existed somewhere  or  other,
        disguised and forgotten. From one ghostly steeple after another
        he  seemed  to  hear them pealing forth. Yet so far as he could
        remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3657"><span data-line="3657"></span>He got away from Mr Charrington and went down  the  stairs
        alone,  so  as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the
        street before stepping out of the door. He had already made  up
        his  mind  that after a suitable interval — a month, say — he
        would take the risk of visiting the shop again. It was  perhaps
        not  more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre. The
        serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the  first
        place,  after  buying the diary and without knowing whether the
        proprietor of the shop could be trusted. However-!
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3667"><span data-line="3667"></span>Yes, he thought again, he would come back.  He  would  buy
        further scraps of beautiful rubbish. He would buy the engraving
        of  St  Clement  Danes,  take it out of its frame, and carry it
        home concealed under the jacket of his overalls. He would  drag
        the  rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington<span data-line="3671"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3671"></span>s memory. Even the
        lunatic  project  of  renting   the   room   upstairs   flashed
        momentarily  through  his  mind again. For perhaps five seconds
        exaltation made him careless, and he  stepped  out  on  to  the
        pavement  without  so  much as a preliminary glance through the
        window. He had even started humming to an improvised tune
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="3678" style="display:block"><code>         Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement&#39;s,
         You owe me three farthings, say the</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="3681"><span data-line="3681"></span>Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his  bowels
        to  water.  A  figure  in  blue  overalls  was  coming down the
        pavement, not ten metres away. It was the girl from the Fiction
        Department, the girl with dark hair. The light was failing, but
        there was no difficulty in  recognizing  her.  She  looked  him
        straight  in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had
        not seen him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3689"><span data-line="3689"></span>For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move.  Then
        he  turned  to  the right and walked heavily away, not noticing
        for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction. At any
        rate, one question was  settled.  There  was  no  doubting  any
        longer  that the girl was spying on him. She must have followed
        him here, because it was not credible that by pure  chance  she
        should  have  happened to be walking on the same evening up the
        same obscure backstreet, kilometres distant  from  any  quarter
        where  Party  members  lived.  It  was too great a coincidence.
        Whether she was really an  agent  of  the  Thought  Police,  or
        simply   an  amateur  spy  actuated  by  officiousness,  hardly
        mattered. It was enough that she was watching him. Probably she
        had seen him go into the pub as well.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3703"><span data-line="3703"></span>It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his  pocket
        banged  against  his thigh at each step, and he was half minded
        to take it out and throw it away. The worst thing was the  pain
        in  his  belly. For a couple of minutes he had the feeling that
        he would die if he did not reach a  lavatory  soon.  But  there
        would  be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the
        spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3711"><span data-line="3711"></span>The street was a blind alley. Winston  halted,  stood  for
        several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round
        and began to retrace his steps. As he turned it occurred to him
        that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by
        running  he  could probably catch up with her. He could keep on
        her track till they were in some quiet place,  and  then  smash
        her  skull  in  with  a  cobblestone. The piece of glass in his
        pocket would be heavy enough for the job. But he abandoned  the
        idea  immediately,  because  even  the  thought  of  making any
        physical effort was unbearable. He could not run, he could  not
        strike  a  blow.  Besides,  she  was  young and lusty and would
        defend herself. He thought also of hurrying  to  the  Community
        Centre  and  staying  there  till  the  place  closed, so as to
        establish a partial alibi for the evening.  But  that  too  was
        impossible.  A  deadly  lassitude had taken hold of him. All he
        wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3728"><span data-line="3728"></span>It was after twenty-two hours when  he  got  back  to  the
        flat.  The  lights  would  be  switched  off  at  the  main  at
        twenty-three thirty. He went into  the  kitchen  and  swallowed
        nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to the table in
        the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. But
        he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female
        voice  was  squalling  a  patriotic song. He sat staring at the
        marbled cover of the book, trying without success to  shut  the
        voice out of his consciousness.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3738"><span data-line="3738"></span>It  was  at night that they came for you, always at night.
        The proper thing was to kill  yourself  before  they  got  you.
        Undoubtedly some people did so. Many of the disappearances were
        actually  suicides.  But  it  needed  desperate courage to kill
        yourself in a world where firearms, or any  quick  and  certain
        poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind of
        astonishment  of  the  biological uselessness of pain and fear,
        the treachery of the  human  body  which  always  freezes  into
        inertia  at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed.
        He might have silenced the dark-haired  girl  if  only  he  had
        acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the extremity of
        his  danger he had lost the power to act. It struck him that in
        moments of crisis one is never  fighting  against  an  external
        enemy, but always against one<span data-line="3751"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3751"></span>s own body. Even now, in spite of
        the  gin,  the  dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought
        impossible. And it is the same, he perceived, in all  seemingly
        heroic or tragic situations. On the battlefield, in the torture
        chamber,  on  a  sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting
        for are always forgotten, because the body swells up  until  it
        fills  the  universe,  and  even  when you are not paralysed by
        fright or screaming  with  pain,  life  is  a  moment-to-moment
        struggle  against  hunger  or  cold or sleeplessness, against a
        sour stomach or an aching tooth.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3762"><span data-line="3762"></span>He opened the diary. It was important to  write  something
        down.  The  woman on the telescreen had started a new song. Her
        voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged  splinters  of
        glass.  He tried to think of O<span data-line="3765"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3765"></span>Brien, for whom, or to whom, the
        diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the  things
        that  would  happen  to  him  after the Thought Police took him
        away. It would not matter if they killed you  at  once.  To  be
        killed was what you expected. But before death (nobody spoke of
        such  things, yet everybody knew of them) there was the routine
        of confession that had to be gone through:  the  grovelling  on
        the  floor  and screaming for mercy, the crack of broken bones,
        the smashed teeth, and bloody clots of hair.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3775"><span data-line="3775"></span>Why did you have to endure it, since the  end  was  always
        the  same?  Why  was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks
        out of your life? Nobody ever  escaped  detection,  and  nobody
        ever  failed  to  confess.  When  once  you  had  succumbed  to
        thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you  would  be
        dead.  Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to
        lie embedded in future time?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3783"><span data-line="3783"></span>He tried with a little more success than before to  summon
        up  the  image  of  O<span data-line="3784"></span>&#8216;Brien.  &#8217;<span data-line="3784"></span><em class="em-low1">We shall meet in the place where
        there is no darkness,</em><span data-line="3785"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3785"></span> O<span data-line="3785"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3785"></span>Brien had said to him. He knew what it
        meant, or thought he knew. The place where there is no darkness
        was the imagined future, which one would never see, but  which,
        by  foreknowledge,  one could mystically share in. But with the
        voice from the telescreen nagging at  his  ears  he  could  not
        follow  the train of thought further. He put a cigarette in his
        mouth. Half the tobacco promptly fell out on to his  tongue,  a
        bitter  dust which was difficult to spit out again. The face of
        Big Brother swam into his mind,  displacing  that  of  O<span data-line="3793"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3793"></span>Brien.
        Just  as  he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of
        his pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at  him,  heavy,
        calm, protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the
        dark moustache? Like a leaden knell the words came back at him:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="3799" style="display:block"><code>         WAR IS PEACE

<p class="p noindent" data-line="3805"><span data-line="3805"></span>It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left the
        cubicle to go to the lavatory.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3808"><span data-line="3808"></span>A  solitary  figure  was coming towards him from the other
        end of the long, brightly-lit corridor. It was  the  girl  with
        dark  hair.  Four  days had gone past since the evening when he
        had run into her outside the junk-shop. As she came  nearer  he
        saw  that  her  right  arm  was in a sling, not noticeable at a
        distance because it was of the same  colour  as  her  overalls.
        Probably  she  had crushed her hand while swinging round one of
        the big  kaleidoscopes  on  which  the  plots  of  novels  were
        <span data-line="3816"></span>&#8216;_roughed   in&#8217;<span data-line="3816"></span>.  It  was  a  common  accident  in  the  Fiction
        Department.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3819"><span data-line="3819"></span>They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled
        and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung
        out of her. She must have fallen  right  on  the  injured  arm.
        Winston  stopped  short.  The  girl had risen to her knees. Her
        face had turned a milky yellow colour against which  her  mouth
        stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an
        appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3827"><span data-line="3827"></span>A  curious emotion stirred in Winston<span data-line="3827"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3827"></span>s heart. In front of
        him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front  of  him,
        also,  was  a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken
        bone. Already he had instinctively started forward to help her.
        In the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm, it
        had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3834"><span data-line="3834"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You&#39;re hurt?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3834"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3836"><span data-line="3836"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s nothing. My arm. It&#39;ll be all right in a second.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3836"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3838"><span data-line="3838"></span>She spoke as though her heart  were  fluttering.  She  had
        certainly turned very pale.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3841"><span data-line="3841"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You haven&#39;t broken anything?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3841"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3843"><span data-line="3843"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No, I&#39;m all right. It hurt for a moment, that&#39;s all.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3843"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3845"><span data-line="3845"></span>She  held  out her free hand to him, and he helped her up.
        She had regained some of her colour,  and  appeared  very  much
        better.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3849"><span data-line="3849"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s  nothing,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3849"></span>  she  repeated  shortly.  <span data-line="3849"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I only gave my
        wrist a bit of a bang. Thanks, comrade!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3850"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3852"><span data-line="3852"></span>And with that she walked on in the direction in which  she
        had  been  going,  as  briskly  as  though  it  had really been
        nothing. The whole incident could not have  taken  as  much  as
        half  a  minute. Not to let one<span data-line="3855"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3855"></span>s feelings appear in one<span data-line="3855"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3855"></span>s face
        was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, and in
        any case  they  had  been  standing  straight  in  front  of  a
        telescreen  when  the  thing happened. Nevertheless it had been
        very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, for  in  the
        two  or  three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had
        slipped something into his hand. There was no question that she
        had done it intentionally. It was something small and flat.  As
        he  passed  through  the lavatory door he transferred it to his
        pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. It was a scrap
        of paper folded into a square.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3867"><span data-line="3867"></span>While he stood at the urinal he  managed,  with  a  little
        more  fingering,  to get it unfolded. Obviously there must be a
        message of some kind written on it. For a moment he was tempted
        to take it into one of the water-closets and read it  at  once.
        But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew. There was no
        place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were
        watched continuously.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3875"><span data-line="3875"></span>He  went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment
        of paper casually among the other papers on the  desk,  put  on
        his  spectacles  and  hitched the speakwrite towards him. <span data-line="3877"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">five
        minutes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3878"></span> he told himself, <span data-line="3878"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">five minutes at  the  very  least!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="3878"></span>
        His  heart  bumped  in  his  breast  with frightening loudness.
        Fortunately the piece of  work  he  was  engaged  on  was  mere
        routine,  the  rectification  of  a  long  list of figures, not
        needing close attention.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3884"><span data-line="3884"></span>Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some  kind
        of  political  meaning.  So  far as he could see there were two
        possibilities. One, much the more likely, was that the girl was
        an agent of the Thought Police, just as he had feared.  He  did
        not  know why the Thought Police should choose to deliver their
        messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had their reasons.
        The thing that was written on the paper might be  a  threat,  a
        summons,   an   order   to  commit  suicide,  a  trap  of  some
        description. But there was  another,  wilder  possibility  that
        kept  raising  its head, though he tried vainly to suppress it.
        This was, that the message did not come from the Thought Police
        at all, but from some kind of underground organization. Perhaps
        the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the girl was part of
        it! No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had  sprung  into  his
        mind  in  the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his
        hand. It was not till a couple of minutes later that the other,
        more probable explanation had occurred to him.  And  even  now,
        though  his  intellect told him that the message probably meant
        death —  still,  that  was  not  what  he  believed,  and  the
        unreasonable  hope  persisted, and his heart banged, and it was
        with difficulty that he kept his voice  from  trembling  as  he
        murmured his figures into the speakwrite.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3907"><span data-line="3907"></span>He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into
        the pneumatic  tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted
        his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew the next batch  of
        work  towards  him,  with  the  scrap of paper on top of it. He
        flattened it out. On  it  was  written,  in  a  large  unformed
        handwriting:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3914"><span data-line="3914"></span>I love you.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3916"><span data-line="3916"></span>For  several  seconds he was too stunned even to throw the
        incriminating thing into the  memory  hole.  When  he  did  so,
        although  he  knew  very  well  the  danger of showing too much
        interest, he could not resist reading it once  again,  just  to
        make sure that the words were really there.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3922"><span data-line="3922"></span>For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work.
        What was  even  worse than having to focus his mind on a series
        of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the
        telescreen. He felt as though a fire were burning in his belly.
        Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen  was  torment.
        He  had  hoped  to be alone for a little while during the lunch
        hour, but as bad  luck  would  have  it  the  imbecile  Parsons
        flopped down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating
        the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the
        preparations  for  Hate  Week. He was particularly enthusiastic
        about a papier-mâché model of Big Brother<span data-line="3932"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3932"></span>s head, two metres
        wide, which was being made for the occasion by  his  daughter<span data-line="3933"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3933"></span>s
        troop  of Spies. The irritating thing was that in the racket of
        voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was  saying,  and
        was  constantly  having  to  ask  for some fatuous remark to be
        repeated. Just once he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table
        with two other girls at the far end of the room.  She  appeared
        not  to  have  seen  him, and he did not look in that direction
        again.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3942"><span data-line="3942"></span>The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately  after  lunch
        there  arrived  a delicate, difficult piece of work which would
        take several hours and  necessitated  putting  everything  else
        aside.  It  consisted  in  falsifying  a  series  of production
        reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on
        a prominent member of the Inner Party,  who  was  now  under  a
        cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and
        for  more  than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out
        of his mind altogether. Then the memory of her face came  back,
        and  with it a raging, intolerable desire to be alone. Until he
        could be alone it was impossible to think this new  development
        out.  Tonight was one of his nights at the Community Centre. He
        wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen,  hurried  off  to
        the  Centre,  took  part in the solemn foolery of a <span data-line="3955"></span>&#8216;_discussion
        group&#8217;<span data-line="3956"></span>, played two games of  table  tennis,  swallowed  several
        glasses  of  gin,  and  sat  for half an hour through a lecture
        entitled <span data-line="3958"></span>&#8216;_Ingsoc in relation to chess&#8217;<span data-line="3958"></span>. His soul  writhed  with
        boredom,  but  for  once  he  had  had  no impulse to shirk his
        evening at the Centre. At the sight  of  the  words  I  love
        you  the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the
        taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was  not  till
        twenty-three  hours,  when  he  was  home  and in bed — in the
        darkness, where you were safe even from the telescreen so  long
        as you kept silent — that he was able to think continuously.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3967"><span data-line="3967"></span>It  was  a  physical problem that had to be solved: how to
        get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting.  He  did  not
        consider  any  longer  the possibility that she might be laying
        some kind of trap for him. He knew that it was not so,  because
        of  her  unmistakable  agitation  when she handed him the note.
        Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well  she
        might  be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross
        his mind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her
        skull in with a cobblestone, but that was of no importance.  He
        thought  of  her naked, youthful body, as he had seen it in his
        dream. He had imagined her a fool like all the  rest  of  them,
        her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her belly full of ice. A
        kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her,
        the  white  youthful  body  might  slip  away from him! What he
        feared more than anything else was that she would simply change
        her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly.  But  the
        physical difficulty of meeting was enormous. It was like trying
        to  make a move at chess when you were already mated. Whichever
        way you turned, the telescreen faced  you.  Actually,  all  the
        possible  ways  of  communicating  with her had occurred to him
        within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with time  to
        think, he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row
        of instruments on a table.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="3991"><span data-line="3991"></span>Obviously  the  kind  of  encounter that had happened this
        morning could not be repeated. If she had worked in the Records
        Department it might have been comparatively simple, but he  had
        only  a  very  dim idea whereabouts in the building the Fiction
        Departrnent lay, and he had no pretext for going there.  If  he
        had  known  where she lived, and at what time she left work, he
        could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but
        to try to follow her home was not safe, because it  would  mean
        loitering  about  outside  the  Ministry, which was bound to be
        noticed. As for sending a letter through the mails, it was  out
        of  the  question.  By  a routine that was not even secret, all
        letters were opened in transit. Actually, few people ever wrote
        letters. For the messages that it was occasionally necessary to
        send, there were printed postcards with long lists of  phrases,
        and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case
        he did not know the girl<span data-line="4006"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4006"></span>s name, let alone her address. Finally
        he  decided  that the safest place was the canteen. If he could
        get her at a table by herself, somewhere in the middle  of  the
        room,  not too near the telescreens, and with a sufficient buzz
        of conversation all round — if these conditions  endured  for,
        say,  thirty  seconds,  it  might be possible to exchange a few
        words.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4014"><span data-line="4014"></span>For a week after this, life was like a restless dream.  On
        the  next  day  she  did not appear in the canteen until he was
        leaving it, the whistle having already  blown.  Presumably  she
        had  been  changed  on to a later shift. They passed each other
        without a glance. On the day after that she was in the  canteen
        at  the  usual time, but with three other girls and immediately
        under a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days  she  did  not
        appear  at  all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted
        with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of  transparency,  which
        made  every  movement,  every  sound, every contact, every word
        that he had to speak or listen to, an agony. Even in  sleep  he
        could  not  altogether  escape from her image. He did not touch
        the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it was in
        his work, in which he could sometimes forget  himself  for  ten
        minutes  at a stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had
        happened to her. There was no enquiry he could make. She  might
        have  been  vaporized,  she  might  have committed suicide, she
        might have been transferred to the other end of Oceania:  worst
        and  likeliest  of  all, she might simply have changed her mind
        and decided to avoid him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4035"><span data-line="4035"></span>The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the  sling
        and  she  had  a  band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The
        relief of seeing her was so great  that  he  could  not  resist
        staring  directly  at her for several seconds. On the following
        day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When  he  came
        into  the  canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the
        wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was  not
        very  full.  The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at
        the counter, then was held up for two minutes  because  someone
        in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of
        saccharine.  But  the girl was still alone when Winston secured
        his tray and began to make for her table.  He  walked  casually
        towards  her,  his  eyes  searching  for  a place at some table
        beyond her. She was perhaps three metres away from him. Another
        two seconds would do  it.  Then  a  voice  behind  him  called,
        <span data-line="4050"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Smith!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4050"></span>  He  pretended  not  to  hear.  <span data-line="4050"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Smith!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4050"></span> repeated the
        voice,  more  loudly.  It  was  no  use.  He  turned  round.  A
        blond-headed,  silly-faced  young  man  named  Wilsher, whom he
        barely knew, was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at
        his table. It  was  not  safe  to  refuse.  After  having  been
        recognized,  he  could  not  go  and  sit  at  a  table with an
        unattended girl. It was too noticeable.  He  sat  down  with  a
        friendly  smile.  The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston
        had a hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe  right  into
        the  middle  of  it.  The  girl<span data-line="4059"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4059"></span>s table filled up a few minutes
        later.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4062"><span data-line="4062"></span>But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps
        she would take the hint. Next day he took care to arrive early.
        Surely enough, she was at a table in about the same place,  and
        again  alone.  The person immediately ahead of him in the queue
        was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man with a  flat  face
        and  tiny,  suspicious  eyes.  As  Winston turned away from the
        counter with his tray, he saw that the little  man  was  making
        straight  for the girl<span data-line="4069"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4069"></span>s table. His hopes sank again. There was
        a vacant place at a table further away, but  something  in  the
        little man<span data-line="4071"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4071"></span>s appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently
        attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table. With
        ice  at  his  heart  Winston  followed. It was no use unless he
        could get the girl alone. At this moment there was a tremendous
        crash. The little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray  had
        gone flying, two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across
        the  floor.  He  started to his feet with a malignant glance at
        Winston, whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him  up.
        But  it  was  all  right. Five seconds later, with a thundering
        heart, Winston was sitting at the girl<span data-line="4080"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4080"></span>s table.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4082"><span data-line="4082"></span>He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and  promptly
        began  eating.  It  was  all-important to speak at once, before
        anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had taken  possession
        of  him. A week had gone by since she had first approached him.
        She would have changed her mind,  she  must  have  changed  her
        mind!   It   was   impossible   that  this  affair  should  end
        successfully; such things did not happen in real life. He might
        have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had
        not seen Ampleforth, the  hairy-eared  poet,  wandering  limply
        round the room with a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In
        his  vague  way  Ampleforth  was attached to Winston, and would
        certainly sit down at his table if  he  caught  sight  of  him.
        There  was  perhaps  a minute in which to act. Both Winston and
        the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating was a
        thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a  low  murmur
        Winston  began  speaking.  Neither  of them looked up; steadily
        they spooned the watery stuff into their  mouths,  and  between
        spoonfuls   exchanged   the   few   necessary   words   in  low
        expressionless voices.

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4125"><span data-line="4125"></span>Ampleforth  failed  to see Winston and sat down at another
        table. They did not speak again, and, so far as it was possible
        for two people sitting on opposite sides  of  the  same  table,
        they  did  not look at one another. The girl finished her lunch
        quickly  and  made  off,  while  Winston  stayed  to  smoke   a
        cigarette.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4132"><span data-line="4132"></span>Winston  was  in Victory Square before the appointed time.
        He wandered round the base of the enormous  fluted  column,  at
        the  top  of which Big Brother<span data-line="4134"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4134"></span>s statue gazed southward towards
        the skies where he had vanquished the Eurasian aeroplanes  (the
        Eastasian  aeroplanes,  it  had  been,  a few years ago) in the
        Battle of Airstrip One. In the street in front of it there  was
        a  statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent
        Oliver Cromwell. At five minutes past the  hour  the  girl  had
        still  not  appeared.  Again  the  terrible  fear  seized  upon
        Winston. She was not coming,  she  had  changed  her  mind!  He
        walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort
        of  pale-coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin<span data-line="4143"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4143"></span>s Church,
        whose bells, when it had bells, had chimed <span data-line="4144"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  owe  me  three
        farthings.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4145"></span>  Then  he  saw the girl standing at the base of the
        monument, reading or pretending to  read  a  poster  which  ran
        spirally  up  the  column. It was not safe to go near her until
        some more people had accumulated. There  were  telescreens  all
        round  the  pediment.  But  at  this  moment there was a din of
        shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles  from  somewhere  to  the
        left. Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square.
        The  girl  nipped  nimbly  round  the  lions at the base of the
        monument and joined in the rush. Winston followed. As  he  ran,
        he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of Eurasian
        prisoners was passing.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4157"><span data-line="4157"></span>Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side
        of the  square. Winston, at normal times the kind of person who
        gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage,  shoved,
        butted,  squirmed  his way forward into the heart of the crowd.
        Soon he was within arm<span data-line="4161"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4161"></span>s length of the girl, but  the  way  was
        blocked  by  an  enormous  prole and an almost equally enormous
        woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an  impenetrable
        wall  of  flesh.  Winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a
        violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them. For a
        moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp
        between the two muscular hips,  then  he  had  broken  through,
        sweating  a little. He was next to the girl. They were shoulder
        to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4171"><span data-line="4171"></span>A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed with
        sub-machine guns standing upright in each corner,  was  passing
        slowly  down  the  street.  In  the trucks little yellow men in
        shabby greenish uniforms were squatting, jammed close together.
        Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out  over  the  sides  of  the
        trucks  utterly  incurious.  Occasionally  when  a truck jolted
        there was a clank-clank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing
        leg-irons. Truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces  passed.
        Winston   knew   they   were   there   but  he  saw  them  only
        intermittently. The girl<span data-line="4180"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4180"></span>s shoulder, and her arm right down  to
        the  elbow, were pressed against his. Her cheek was almost near
        enough for him to feel its warmth. She  had  immediately  taken
        charge  of  the situation, just as she had done in the canteen.
        She began speaking in the same expressionless voice as  before,
        with  lips  barely  moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the
        din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks.

<p class="p indent" data-line="4199"><span data-line="4199"></span>With a sort of military precision that astonished him, she
        outlined  the  route that he was to follow. A half-hour railway
        journey; turn left outside the station;  two  kilometres  along
        the  road:  a  gate  with  the top bar missing; a path across a
        field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes; a dead  tree
        with  moss  on  it.  It  was as though she had a map inside her
        head. <span data-line="4205"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Can you remember all that?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4205"></span> she murmured finally.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4207"><span data-line="4207"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4207"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4209"><span data-line="4209"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You turn left, then  right,  then  left  again.  And  the
        gate&#39;s got no top bar.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4210"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4212"><span data-line="4212"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes. What time?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4212"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4214"><span data-line="4214"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">About  fifteen.  You  may have to wait. I&#39;ll get there by
        another way. Are you sure you remember everything?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4215"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4217"><span data-line="4217"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4217"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4219"><span data-line="4219"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Then get away from me as quick as you can.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4219"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4221"><span data-line="4221"></span>She need not have told him that. But for the  moment  they
        could  not extricate themselves from the crowd. The trucks were
        still filing post, the people still insatiably gaping.  At  the
        start  there  had  been a few boos and hisses, but it came only
        from the Party members among the crowd, and had  soon  stopped.
        The   prevailing  emotion  was  simply  curiosity.  Foreigners,
        whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind  of  strange
        animal.  One  literally  never  saw them except in the guise of
        prisoners, and even as prisoners one  never  got  more  than  a
        momentary  glimpse  of  them.  Nor  did one know what became of
        them, apart from the few who were hanged as  war-criminals:  te
        others  simply  vanished,  presumably into forced-labour camps.
        The round Mogol faces had given way to faces of a more European
        type,  dirty,  bearded  and  exhausted.   From   over   scrubby
        cheekbones  eyes  looked into Winston<span data-line="4235"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4235"></span>s, sometimes with strange
        intensity, and flashed away again. The convoy was drawing to an
        end. In the last truck he could see an aged  man,  his  face  a
        mass  of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists crossed in
        front of him, as though he  were  used  to  having  them  bound
        together.  It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part.
        But at the last moment, while the crowd still hemmed  them  in,
        her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting squeeze.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4244"><span data-line="4244"></span>It  could  not  have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a
        long time that their hands were clasped together. He  had  time
        to  learn  every  detail  of  her  hand.  He  explored the long
        fingers, the shapely nails, the work-hardened palm with its row
        of callouses, the smooth flesh under  the  wrist.  Merely  from
        feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the same instant
        it  occurred to him that he did not know what colour the girl<span data-line="4250"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4250"></span>s
        eyes were. They were probably brown, but people with dark  hair
        sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at her would
        have  been  inconceivable  folly.  With  hands locked together,
        invisible among the press of bodies, they  stared  steadily  in
        front of them, and instead of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of
        the  aged  prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston out of nests of
        hair.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="4261"><span data-line="4261"></span>Winston picked his way up the lane through  dappled  light
        and  shade, stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs
        parted. Under the trees to the left of him the ground was misty
        with bluebells. The air seemed to kiss one<span data-line="4264"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4264"></span>s skin. It  was  the
        second  of  May. From somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood
        came the droning of ring doves.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4268"><span data-line="4268"></span>He was a bit early. There had been no  difficulties  about
        the  journey, and the girl was so evidently experienced that he
        was  less  frightened  than  he  would  normally   have   been.
        Presumably  she  could  be  trusted  to  find  a safe place. In
        general you could not assume that you were much  safer  in  the
        country  than  in London. There were no telescreens, of course,
        but there was always the danger  of  concealed  microphones  by
        which your voice might be picked up and recognized; besides, it
        was  not  easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting
        attention. For distances of less than 100 kilometres it was not
        necessary to get your passport endorsed,  but  sometimes  there
        were  patrols  hanging about the railway stations, who examined
        the papers of any Party  member  they  found  there  and  asked
        awkward questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the
        walk  from  the  station  he had made sure by cautious backward
        glances that he was not being followed. The train was  full  of
        proles,  in  holiday  mood  because of the summery weather. The
        wooden-seated carriage in which he  travelled  was  filled  to
        overflowing  by  a  single  enormous  family.  ranging  from  a
        toothless great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going  out  to
        spend  an afternoon with <span data-line="4288"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">in-laws</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4288"></span> in the country, and, as they
        freely  explained  to  Winston,  to  get  hold  of   a   little
        blackmarket butter.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4292"><span data-line="4292"></span>The  lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath
        she had told him of, a mere cattle-track which plunged  between
        the  bushes.  He had no watch, but it could not be fifteen yet.
        The bluebells were so thick underfoot that  it  was  impossible
        not  to  tread  on  them.  He knelt down and began picking some
        partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague  idea  that
        he  would  like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl
        when they met. He had got together a big bunch and was smelling
        their faint sickly scent when a sound at his  back  froze  him,
        the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs. He went on picking
        bluebells.  It  was the best thing to do. It might be the girl,
        or he might have been followed after all. To look round was  to
        show  guilt. He picked another and another. A hand fell lightly
        on his shoulder.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4307"><span data-line="4307"></span>He looked up.  It  was  the  girl.  She  shook  her  head,
        evidently  as  a  warning that he must keep silent, then parted
        the bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track  into
        the  wood.  Obviously  she  had  been  that way before, for she
        dodged the boggy bits as though  by  habit.  Winston  followed,
        still  clasping  his  bunch  of  flowers. His first feeling was
        relief, but as he watched the strong  slender  body  moving  in
        front  of him, with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough
        to bring out the curve of  her  hips,  the  sense  of  his  own
        inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite likely
        that  when  she  turned  round and looked at him she would draw
        back after all. The sweetness of the air and the  greenness  of
        the  leaves  daunted  him. Already on the walk from the station
        the May sunshine had made  him  feel  dirty  and  etiolated,  a
        creature of indoors, with the sooty dust of London in the pores
        of  his skin. It occurred to him that till now she had probably
        never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to  the
        fallen  tree  that  she had spoken of. The girl hopped over and
        forced apart the bushes, in which there did not seem to  be  an
        opening.  When Winston followed her, he found that they were in
        a natural clearing, a tiny  grassy  knoll  surrounded  by  tall
        saplings  that  shut  it  in  completely.  The girl stopped and
        turned.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4331"><span data-line="4331"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Here we are,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4331"></span> she said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4333"><span data-line="4333"></span>He was facing her at several paces<span data-line="4333"></span>_<span data-line="4333"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4333"></span> distance.  As  yet  he
        did not dare move nearer to her.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4336"><span data-line="4336"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  didn&#39;t want to say anything in the lane,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4336"></span> she went on,
        <span data-line="4337"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">in case there&#39;s a mike hidden there. I don&#39;t suppose there is,
        but there could be. There&#39;s always the chance of one  of  those
        swine recognizing your voice. We&#39;re all right here.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4339"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4341"><span data-line="4341"></span>He  still  had not the courage to approach her. <span data-line="4341"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We&#39;re all
        right here?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4342"></span> he repeated stupidly.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4344"><span data-line="4344"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes. Look at the trees.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4344"></span> They were small ashes, which  at
        some  time  had  been cut down and had sprouted up again into a
        forest of  poles,  none  of  them  thicker  than  one<span data-line="4346"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4346"></span>s  wrist.
        <span data-line="4347"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There&#39;s  nothing  big  enough to hide a mike in. Besides, I&#39;ve
        been here before.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4348"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4350"><span data-line="4350"></span>They were only making conversation. He had managed to move
        closer to her now. She stood before him very  upright,  with  a
        smile  on  her face that looked faintly ironical, as though she
        were wondering why he was so slow to  act.  The  bluebells  had
        cascaded  on to the ground. They seemed to have fallen of their
        own accord. He took her hand.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4357"><span data-line="4357"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Would you believe,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4357"></span> he said, <span data-line="4357"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">that  till  this  moment  I
        didn&#39;t  know  what  colour your eyes were?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4358"></span> They were brown, he
        noted, a rather light shade of brown, with  dark  lashes.  <span data-line="4359"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Now
        that  you&#39;ve  seen  what I&#39;m really like, can you still bear to
        look at me?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4361"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4363"><span data-line="4363"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes, easily.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4363"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4365"><span data-line="4365"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;m thirty-nine years old. I&#39;ve got a wife that  I  can&#39;t
        get  rid  of.  I&#39;ve  got  varicose  veins.  I&#39;ve got five false
        teeth.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4367"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4369"><span data-line="4369"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I couldn&#39;t care less,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4369"></span> said the girl.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4371"><span data-line="4371"></span>The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she  was
        in  his  his  arms.  At  the beginning he had no feeling except
        sheer incredulity. The youthful body was strained  against  his
        own,  the  mass  of  dark  hair was against his face, and yes!
        actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide
        red mouth. She had clasped her arms about  his  neck,  she  was
        calling him darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled her
        down on to the ground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do
        what  he  liked  with  her.  But  the  truth was that he had no
        physical sensation, except that of mere contact.  All  he  felt
        was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this was happening,
        but  he  had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth and
        prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used  to  living
        without  women  —  he did not know the reason. The girl picked
        herself up and pulled a bluebell  out  of  her  hair.  She  sat
        against him, putting her arm round his waist.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4388"><span data-line="4388"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Never  mind,  dear. There&#39;s no hurry. We&#39;ve got the whole
        afternoon. Isn&#39;t this a splendid hide-out? I found  it  when  I
        got  lost  once  on  a community hike. If anyone was coming you
        could hear them a hundred metres away.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4391"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4393"><span data-line="4393"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What is your name?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4393"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4395"><span data-line="4395"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Julia. I know yours. It&#39;s Winston — Winston Smith.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4395"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4397"><span data-line="4397"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">How did you find that out?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4397"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4399"><span data-line="4399"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I expect I&#39;m better at finding things out than  you  are,
        dear.  Tell me, what did you think of me before that day I gave
        you the note?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4401"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4403"><span data-line="4403"></span>He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. It was
        even a sort of love-offering to start off by telling the worst.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4406"><span data-line="4406"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I hated the sight of you,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4406"></span> he said. <span data-line="4406"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I wanted to rape you
        and then  murder  you  afterwards.  Two  weeks  ago  I  thought
        seriously  of  smashing your head in with a cobblestone. If you
        really want to know, I imagined that you had  something  to  do
        with the Thought Police.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4410"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4412"><span data-line="4412"></span>The  girl  laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as a
        tribute to the excellence of her disguise.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4415"><span data-line="4415"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Not the Thought Police! You didn&#39;t honestly think that?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4415"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4417"><span data-line="4417"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Well, perhaps not exactly that.  But  from  your  general
        appearance  —  merely  because  you&#39;re  young  and  fresh  and
        healthy, you understand — I thought that probably-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4419"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4421"><span data-line="4421"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in  word  and
        deed. Banners, processions, slogans, games, community hikes all
        that stuff. And you thought that if I had a quarter of a chance
        I&#39;d denounce you as a thought-criminal and get you killed off?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4424"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4426"><span data-line="4426"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girls are
        like that, you know.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4427"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4429"><span data-line="4429"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s  this  bloody thing that does it,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4429"></span> she said, ripping
        off the scarlet sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League and flinging
        it on to a bough.  Then,  as  though  touching  her  waist  had
        reminded  her  of  something,  she  felt  in  the pocket of her
        overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. She  broke  it
        in  half  and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even before he
        had taken it he knew by the smell  that  it  was  very  unusual
        chocolate.  It  was  dark  and shiny, and was wrapped in silver
        paper. Chocolate normally  was  dull-brown  crumbly  stuff  that
        tasted, as nearly as one could describe it, like the smoke of a
        rubbish  fire.  But  at  some  time  or  another  he had tasted
        chocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff  of
        its  scent  had  stirred  up some memory which he could not pin
        down, but which was powerful and troubling.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4444"><span data-line="4444"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Where did you get this stuff?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4444"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4446"><span data-line="4446"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Black market,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4446"></span> she said  indifferently.  <span data-line="4446"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Actually  I  am
        that  sort  of  girl,  to  look  at. I&#39;m good at games. I was a
        troop-leader in the Spies. I do voluntary work three evenings a
        week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours and hours I&#39;ve spent
        pasting their bloody rot all over London. I  always  carry  one
        end  of a banner in the processions. I always Iook cheerful and
        I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, that&#39;s what
        I say. It&#39;s the only way to be safe.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4453"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4455"><span data-line="4455"></span>The first fragment of chocolate had  melted  on  Winston<span data-line="4455"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4455"></span>s
        tongue.  The  taste  was  delightful.  But there was still that
        memory moving round the edges of his  consciousness,  something
        strongly  felt  but  not  reducible  to definite shape, like an
        object seen out of the corner of one<span data-line="4459"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4459"></span>s eye. He pushed  it  away
        from  him,  aware  only  that  it was the memory of some action
        which he would have liked to undo but could not.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4463"><span data-line="4463"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You are very young,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4463"></span> he said. <span data-line="4463"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  are  ten  or  fifteen
        years younger than I am. What could you see to attract you in a
        man like me?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4465"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4467"><span data-line="4467"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It  was  something  in  your  face.  I thought I&#39;d take a
        chance. I&#39;m good at spotting people who don&#39;t belong.  As  soon
        as I saw you I knew you were against them.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4469"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4471"><span data-line="4471"></span>Them,  it  appeared, meant the Party, and above all
        the Inner Party, about whom she talked  with  an  open  jeering
        hatred  which  made  Winston feel uneasy, although he knew that
        they were safe here if they could be  safe  anywhere.  A  thing
        that  astonished  him  about  her  was  the  coarseness  of her
        language. Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston
        himself very seldom did  swear,  aloud,  at  any  rate.  Julia,
        however, seemed unable to mention the Party, and especially the
        Inner  Party,  without  using  the  kind  of words that you saw
        chalked up in dripping alley-ways. He did not  dislike  it.  It
        was  merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all
        its ways, and somehow it seemed natural and healthy,  like  the
        sneeze  of  a  horse  that  smells  bad  hay. They had left the
        clearing and were wandering again through the chequered  shade,
        with  their arms round each other<span data-line="4485"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4485"></span>s waists whenever it was wide
        enough to walk two abreast. He  noticed  how  much  softer  her
        waist  seemed  to feel now that the sash was gone. They did not
        speak above a whisper. Outside the clearing, Julia said, it was
        better to go quietly. Presently they had reached  the  edge  of
        the little wood. She stopped him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4492"><span data-line="4492"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Don&#39;t  go  out  into  the  open.  There  might be someone
        watching. We&#39;re all right if we keep behind the boughs.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4493"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4495"><span data-line="4495"></span>They were standing in  the  shade  of  hazel  bushes.  The
        sunlight,  filtering  through innumerable leaves, was still hot
        on their faces. Winston looked out into the field  beyond,  and
        underwent  a  curious, slow shock of recognition. He knew it by
        sight. An old, closebitten pasture, with a  footpath  wandering
        across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on
        the  opposite  side  the  boughs  of  the elm trees swayed just
        perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly  in
        dense  masses  like  women<span data-line="4503"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4503"></span>s hair. Surely somewhere nearby, but
        out of sight, there must be a stream  with  green  pools  where
        dace were swimming?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4507"><span data-line="4507"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Isn&#39;t there a stream somewhere near here?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4507"></span> he whispered.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4509"><span data-line="4509"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That&#39;s  right, there is a stream. It&#39;s at the edge of the
        next field, actually. There are fish in it, great big ones. You
        can watch them lying in  the  pools  under  the  willow  trees,
        waving their tails.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4512"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4514"><span data-line="4514"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s the Golden Country — almost,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4514"></span> he murmured.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4516"><span data-line="4516"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The Golden Country?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4516"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4518"><span data-line="4518"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s  nothing, really. A landscape I&#39;ve seen sometimes in
        a dream.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4519"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4521"><span data-line="4521"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Look!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4521"></span> whispered Julia.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4523"><span data-line="4523"></span>A thrush had alighted on a bough  not  five  metres  away,
        almost  at  the  level  of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen
        them. It was in the sun, they in the shade. It spread  out  its
        wings,  fitted them carefully into place again, ducked its head
        for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the  sun,
        and  then  began  to  pour  forth  a  torrent  of  song. In the
        afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling.  Winston  and
        Julia  clung  together,  fascinated.  The music went on and on,
        minute after minute, with astonishing  variations,  never  once
        repeating  itself,  almost as though the bird were deliberately
        showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes  it  stopped  for  a  few
        seconds,  spread  out and resettled its wings, then swelled its
        speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston  watched  it
        with  a  sort  of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that
        bird singing? No mate, no rival was watching it. What  made  it
        sit  at  the  edge  of  the lonely wood and pour its music into
        nothingness?  He  wondered  whether  after  all  there  was   a
        microphone  hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only
        in low whispers, and it would not pick up what they  had  said,
        but  it  would  pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of
        the  instrument  some  small,  beetle-like  man  was  listening
        intently  — listening to that. But by degrees the flood
        of music drove all speculations out of  his  mind.  It  was  as
        though  it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him
        and got mixed up with the sunlight that  filtered  through  the
        leaves.  He  stopped thinking and merely felt. The girl<span data-line="4548"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4548"></span>s waist
        in the bend of his arm was soft and warm. He pulled  her  round
        so  that  they  were  breast to breast; her body seemed to melt
        into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all  as  yielding  as
        water. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different from
        the  hard  kisses  they  had exchanged earlier. When they moved
        their faces apart again both of them sighed  deeply.  The  bird
        took fright and fled with a clatter of wings.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4557"><span data-line="4557"></span>Winston  put  his  lips  against her ear. <span data-line="4557"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Now,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4557"></span> he
        whispered.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4560"><span data-line="4560"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Not here,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4560"></span> she whispered back. <span data-line="4560"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Come back  to  the  hide-
        out. It&#39;s safer.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4561"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4563"><span data-line="4563"></span>Quickly,   with  an  occasional  crackle  of  twigs,  they
        threaded their way back to the clearing. When  they  were  once
        inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him. They were
        both  breathing  fast.  but  the smile had reappeared round the
        corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an  instant,
        then  felt  at  the  zipper  of  her overalls. And, yes! it was
        almost as in his dream. Almost as swiftly as  he  had  imagined
        it, she had torn her clothes off, and when she flung them aside
        it  was  with  that  same  magnificent gesture by which a whole
        civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her body  gleamed  white
        in  the  sun. But for a moment he did not look at her body; his
        eyes were anchored by the freckled face with  its  faint,  bold
        smile. He knelt down before her and took her hands in his

<p class="p indent" data-line="4577"><span data-line="4577"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Have you done this before?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4577"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4579"><span data-line="4579"></span>&#8216;_Of  course.  Hundreds  of  times  — well scores of times
        anyway
             &#8217;<span data-line="4581"></span><em class="em-low1">With Party members.</em><span data-line="4581"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4581"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4583"><span data-line="4583"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes, always with Party members.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4583"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4585"><span data-line="4585"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">With members of the Inner Party?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4585"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4587"><span data-line="4587"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Not  with  those  swine,  no.  But  there&#39;s  plenty  that
        would  if they got half a chance. They&#39;re not so holy as
        they make out.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4589"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4591"><span data-line="4591"></span>His heart leapt. Scores of  times  she  had  done  it:  he
        wished  it had been hundreds — thousands. Anything that hinted
        at corruption always filled him with a  wild  hope.  Who  knew,
        perhaps  the  Party  was  rotten under the surface, its cult of
        strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing iniquity.
        If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or
        syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot, to
        weaken, to undermine! He pulled her  down  so  that  they  were
        kneeling face to face.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4601"><span data-line="4601"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Listen.  The more men you&#39;ve had, the more I love you. Do

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4604"><span data-line="4604"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes, perfectly.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4604"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4606"><span data-line="4606"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4606"></span>_<span data-line="4606"></span>I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don<span data-line="4606"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4606"></span>t want  any  virtue
        to exist anywhere. I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4609"><span data-line="4609"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Well  then, I ought to suit you, dear. I&#39;m corrupt to the
        bones.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4610"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4612"><span data-line="4612"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You like doing this? I don&#39;t mean simply me: I  mean  the
        thing in itself?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4613"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4615"><span data-line="4615"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I adore it.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4615"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4617"><span data-line="4617"></span>That  was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely the
        love  of  one  person  but  the  animal  instinct,  the  simple
        undifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear the
        Party  to pieces. He pressed her down upon the grass, among the
        fallen bluebells. This time there was no difficulty.  Presently
        the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed,
        and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The sun
        seemed  to have grown hotter. They were both sleepy. He reached
        out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her.
        Almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an
        hour.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4629"><span data-line="4629"></span>Winston woke first. He sat up  and  watched  the  freckled
        face,  still  peacefully  asleep,  pillowed  on the palm of her
        hand. Except for her mouth, you could not call  her  beautiful.
        There  was a line or two round the eyes, if you looked closely.
        The short dark hair was  extraordinarily  thick  and  soft.  It
        occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where
        she lived.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4637"><span data-line="4637"></span>The  young,  strong  body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in
        him a pitying, protecting feeling. But the mindless  tenderness
        that  he  had  felt  under the hazel tree, while the thrush was
        singing, had not quite come back. He pulled the overalls  aside
        and  studied  her  smooth  white  flank.  In  the  old days, he
        thought, a man looked at a girl<span data-line="4642"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4642"></span>s body  and  saw  that  it  was
        desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not
        have  pure  love  or  pure  lust nowadays. No emotion was pure,
        because everything was mixed up with  fear  and  hatred.  Their
        embrace  had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow
        struck against the Party. It was a political act.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="4651"><span data-line="4651"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We can come here once again,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4651"></span> said Julia. <span data-line="4651"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s generally
        safe to use any hide-out twice. But not for  another  month  or
        two, of course.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4653"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4655"><span data-line="4655"></span>As  soon  as  she  woke  up her demeanour had changed. She
        became alert and business-like, put her clothes on, knotted the
        scarlet sash about her waist, and began arranging  the  details
        of  the  journey  home. It seemed natural to leave this to her.
        She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked, and
        she  seemed  also  to  have  an  exhaustive  knowledge  of  the
        countryside   round   London,   stored  away  from  innumerable
        community hikes. The route she gave  him  was  quite  different
        from  the  one  by  which he had come, and brought him out at a
        different railway station. <span data-line="4664"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Never go home the same way  as  you
        went out,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4665"></span> she said, as though enunciating an important general
        principle.  She would leave first, and Winston was to wait half
        an hour before following her.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4669"><span data-line="4669"></span>She had named a place where they could  meet  after  work,
        four  evenings  hence.  It  was  a  street in one of the poorer
        quarters, where there was an open market  which  was  generally
        crowded and noisy. She would be hanging about among the stalls,
        pretending  to  be in search of shoelaces or sewing-thread. If
        she judged that the coast was clear she  would  blow  her  nose
        when  he  approached; otherwise he was to walk past her without
        recognition. But with luck, in the  middle  of  the  crowd,  it
        would  be  safe  to  talk  for a quarter of an hour and arrange
        another meeting.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4680"><span data-line="4680"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And now I must go,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4680"></span> she said as soon as he  had  mastered
        his instructions. <span data-line="4681"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;m due back at nineteen-thirty. I&#39;ve got to
        put  in  two  hours for the Junior Anti-Sex League, handing out
        leaflets, or something. Isn&#39;t it bloody? Give me a  brush-down,
        would  you? Have I got any twigs in my hair? Are you sure? Then
        good-bye, my love, good-bye!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4685"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4687"><span data-line="4687"></span>She  flung  herself  into  his  arms,  kissed  him  almost
        violently,  and  a  moment  later  pushed  her  way through the
        saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little  noise.
        Even  now  he  had  not  found  out her surname or her address.
        However, it made no difference, for it was  inconceivable  that
        they  could  ever  meet indoors or exchange any kind of written
        communication.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4695"><span data-line="4695"></span>As it happened, they never went back to  the  clearing  in
        the  wood.  During  the month of May there was only one further
        occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love.  That
        was  in  another  hidlng-place  known to Julia, the belfry of a
        ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of  country  where
        an  atomic  bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a good
        hiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was
        very dangerous. For the  rest  they  could  meet  only  in  the
        streets,  in a different place every evening and never for more
        than half an hour at a time.  In  the  street  it  was  usually
        possible  to  talk,  after  a fashion. As they drifted down the
        crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking  at  one
        another,  they  carried on a curious, intermittent conversation
        which flicked on and  off  like  the  beams  of  a  lighthouse,
        suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a Party uniform
        or  the  proximity of a telescreen, then taken up again minutes
        later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly cut  short  as
        they  parted  at the agreed spot, then continued almost without
        introduction on the following day. Julia appeared to  be  quite
        used to this kind of conversation, which she called <span data-line="4714"></span>&#8216;_talking by
        instalments&#8217;<span data-line="4715"></span>.  She  was  also  surprisingly  adept  at speaking
        without moving her lips. Just once in almost a month of nightly
        meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They were passing  in
        silence  down  a side-street (Julia would never speak when they
        were away from the main streets) when  there  was  a  deafening
        roar, the earth heaved, and the air darkened, and Winston found
        himself lying on his side, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb
        must  have dropped quite near at hand. Suddenly he became aware
        of Julia<span data-line="4723"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4723"></span>s face a few centimetres from his own, deathly  white,
        as  white  as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was dead! He
        clasped her against him and found that he was  kissing  a  live
        warm face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way
        of  his  lips.  Both  of  their  faces were thickly coated with
        plaster.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4730"><span data-line="4730"></span>There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and
        then had to walk past one another without  a  sign,  because  a
        patrol  had  just  come  round  the  corner or a helicopter was
        hovering overhead. Even if it had been less dangerous, it would
        still have been difficult  to  find  time  to  meet.  Winston<span data-line="4734"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4734"></span>s
        working  week  was  sixty  hours,  Julia<span data-line="4735"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4735"></span>s was even longer, and
        their free days varied according to the pressure  of  work  and
        did  not  often  coincide.  Julia,  in  any case, seldom had an
        evening completely free. She spent  an  astonishing  amount  of
        time  in  attending  lectures  and demonstrations, distributing
        literature for the junior Anti-Sex  League,  preparing  banners
        for Hate Week, making collections for the savings campaign, and
        such-like  activities. It paid, she said, it was camouflage. If
        you kept the small rules, you could break  the  big  ones.  She
        even induced Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by
        enrolling  himself  for  the  part-time munition work which was
        done voluntarily by zealous  Party  members.  So,  one  evening
        every  week,  Winston  spent  four hours of paralysing boredom,
        screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts
        of bomb fuses,  in  a  draughty,  ill-lit  workshop  where  the
        knocking  of  hammers  mingled  drearily  with the music of the
        telescreens.

<p class="p indent" data-line="4753"><span data-line="4753"></span>When they met in  the  church  tower  the  gaps  in  their
        fragmentary  conversation  were  filled  up.  It  was a blazing
        afternoon. The air in the little square chamber above the bells
        was hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon  dung.
        They  sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig-littered floor,
        one or other of them getting up from time to  time  to  cast  a
        glance  through  the  arrowslits  and make sure that no one was
        coming.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4762"><span data-line="4762"></span>Julia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel with
        thirty other girls (<span data-line="4763"></span>&#8216;Always in the stink of women! How  I  hate
        women!_&#8217;<span data-line="4764"></span>  she  said  parenthetically), and she worked, as he had
        guessed,  on  the  novel-writing  machines   in   the   Fiction
        Department.  She  enjoyed  her work, which consisted chiefly in
        running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor. She
        was <span data-line="4768"></span>&#8216;_not clever&#8217;<span data-line="4768"></span>, but was fond of using her hands and  felt  at
        home  with  machinery.  She could describe the whole process of
        composing a novel, from the general  directive  issued  by  the
        Planning Committee down to the final touching-up by the Rewrite
        Squad.  But she was not interested in the finished product. She
        <span data-line="4773"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">didn&#39;t much care for reading,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4773"></span> she said.  Books  were  just  a
        commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4776"><span data-line="4776"></span>She  had  no memories of anything before the early sixties
        and the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of
        the days before  the  Revolution  was  a  grandfather  who  had
        disappeared  when she was eight. At school she had been captain
        of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two  years
        running.  She had been a troop-leader in the Spies and a branch
        secretary  in  the  Youth  League  before  joining  the  Junior
        Anti-Sex  League.  She had always borne an excellent character.
        She had even (an  infallible  mark  of  good  reputation)  been
        picked out to work in Pornosec, the sub-section of the Fiction
        Department  which turned out cheap pornography for distribution
        among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House by the people who
        worked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for a  year,
        helping  to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like
        Spanking Stories or  One  Night  in  a  Girls<span data-line="4790"></span>_<span data-line="4790"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4790"></span>
        School,  to  be  bought furtively by proletarian youths who
        were under the  impression  that  they  were  buying  something
        illegal.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4795"><span data-line="4795"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What are these books like?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4795"></span> said Winston curiously.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4797"><span data-line="4797"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oh,  ghastly  rubbish.  They&#39;re boring, really. They only
        have six plots, but they swap them round a bit. Of course I was
        only on the kaleidoscopes. I was never in  the  Rewrite  Squad.
        I&#39;m not literary, dear — not even enough for that.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4800"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4802"><span data-line="4802"></span>He  learned  with  astonishment  that  all  the workers in
        Pornosec, except the heads of the departments, were girls.  The
        theory was that men, whose sex instincts were less controllable
        than  those of women, were in greater danger of being corrupted
        by the filth they handled.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4808"><span data-line="4808"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They don&#39;t even like having  married  women  there,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4808"></span>  she
        added.  Girls are always supposed to be so pure. Here<span data-line="4809"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4809"></span>s one who
        isn<span data-line="4810"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4810"></span>t, anyway.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4812"><span data-line="4812"></span>She had had her first love-affair when  she  was  sixteen,
        with  a  Party  member  of sixty who later committed suicide to
        avoid arrest. <span data-line="4814"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And a good  job  too,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4814"></span>  said  Julia,  <span data-line="4814"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">otherwise
        they&#39;d  have  had  my name out of him when he confessed.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4815"></span> Since
        then there had been various others. Life  as  she  saw  it  was
        quite  simple.  You  wanted  a  good  time; <span data-line="4817"></span>&#8216;_they&#8217;<span data-line="4817"></span>, meaning the
        Party, wanted to stop you having it; you  broke  the  rules  as
        best  you  couId.  She  seemed to think it just as natural that
        <span data-line="4820"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">they</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4820"></span> should want to rob you of your  pleasures  as  that  you
        should  want  to  avoid  being caught. She hated the Party, and
        said so in the crudest words, but she made no general criticism
        of it. Except where it touched upon her own  life  she  had  no
        interest  in  Party  doctrine.  He  noticed that she never used
        Newspeak words except the ones that had  passed  into  everyday
        use.  She  had  never  heard of the Brotherhood, and refused to
        believe in its existence. Any kind of organized revolt  against
        the  Party,  which  was  bound  to  be a failure, struck her as
        stupid. The clever thing was to break the rules and stay  alive
        all  the  same.  He  wondered  vaguely how many others like her
        there might be in the younger generation people who  had  grown
        up  in  the  world  of  the  Revolution,  knowing nothing else,
        accepting the Party as something unalterable, like the sky, not
        rebelling against its authority but simply  evading  it,  as  a
        rabbit dodges a dog.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4837"><span data-line="4837"></span>They  did  not discuss the possibility of getting married.
        It was too remote to be worth  thinking  about.  No  imaginable
        committee   would   ever  sanction  such  a  marriage  even  if
        Katharine, Winston<span data-line="4840"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4840"></span>s wife, could somehow have been got rid  of.
        It was hopeless even as a daydream.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4843"><span data-line="4843"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What was she like, your wife?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4843"></span> said Julia.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4845"><span data-line="4845"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">She    was   —   do   you   know   the   Newspeak   word
        goodthinkful? Meaning naturally orthodox,  incapable  of
        thinking a bad thought?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4847"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4849"><span data-line="4849"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No,  I  didn&#39;t  know  the  word,  but  I know the kind of
        person, right enough.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4850"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4852"><span data-line="4852"></span>He began telling her the story of his  married  life,  but
        curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it
        already. She described to him, almost as though she had seen or
        felt  it,  the  stiffening  of  Katharine<span data-line="4855"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4855"></span>s  body as soon as he
        touched her, the way in which she still seemed  to  be  pushing
        him  from  her  with  all her strength, even when her arms were
        clasped tightly round him. With Julia he felt no difficulty  in
        talking  about  such  things:  Katharine, in any case, had long
        ceased to be a painful memory and became merely  a  distasteful
        one.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4863"><span data-line="4863"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  could  have stood it if it hadn&#39;t been for one thing,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4863"></span>
        he said. He toId her about  the  frigid  little  ceremony  that
        Katharine  had forced him to go through on the same night every
        week. <span data-line="4866"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">She hated it, but nothing would make her stop doing  it.
        She used to call it — but you&#39;ll never guess.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4867"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4869"><span data-line="4869"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Our duty to the Party,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4869"></span> said Julia promptly.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4871"><span data-line="4871"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">How did you know that?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4871"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4873"><span data-line="4873"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;ve been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month for
        the over-sixteens.  And in the Youth Movement. They rub it into
        you for years. I dare say it works in a lot of  cases.  But  of
        course you can never tell; people are such hypocrites.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4876"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4878"><span data-line="4878"></span>She  began  to  enlarge  upon  the  subject.  With  Julia,
        everything came back to her own sexuality. As soon as this  was
        touched  upon  in  any  way she was capable of great acuteness.
        Unlike Winston, she  had  grasped  the  inner  meaning  of  the
        Party<span data-line="4882"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4882"></span>s  sexual  puritanism.  It  was  not  merely that the sex
        instinct created a world of  its  own  which  was  outside  the
        Party<span data-line="4884"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4884"></span>s  control  and  which  therefore  had to be destroyed if
        possible. What was more important  was  that  sexual  privation
        induced  hysteria,  which  was  desirable  because  it could be
        transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way she  put
        it was:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4890"><span data-line="4890"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">When you make love you&#39;re using up energy; and afterwards
        you feel  happy  and don&#39;t give a damn for anything. They can&#39;t
        bear you to feel like that. They want you to be  bursting  with
        energy all the time. All this marching up and down and cheering
        and  waving  flags  is  simply  sex  gone sour. If you&#39;re happy
        inside yourself, why should you get excited about  Big  Brother
        and  the  Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the
        rest of their bloody rot?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4897"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4899"><span data-line="4899"></span>That was  very  true,  he  thought.  There  was  a  direct
        intimate  connexion  between  chastity and political orthodoxy.
        For how could the fear, the hatred, and the  lunatic  credulity
        which  the  Party  needed  in  its members be kept at the right
        pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using
        it as a driving force? The sex impulse  was  dangerous  to  the
        Party,  and the Party had turned it to account. They had played
        a similar trick with the instinct  of  parenthood.  The  family
        could  not  actually  be  abolished,  and,  indeed, people were
        encouraged  to  be  fond  of  their  children,  in  almost  the
        old-fashioned  way.  The  children,  on  the  other  hand, were
        systematically turned against their parents and taught  to  spy
        on  them  and report their deviations. The family had become in
        effect an extension of the Thought Police. It was a  device  by
        means  of  which  everyone could be surrounded night and day by
        informers who knew him intimately.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4916"><span data-line="4916"></span>Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine  would
        unquestionably  have denounced him to the Thought Police if she
        had not happened to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy  of
        his  opinions.  But  what  really  recalled  her to him at this
        moment was the  stifling  heat  of  the  afternoon,  which  had
        brought  the  sweat out on his forehead. He began telling Julia
        of something that had happened, or rather had failed to happen,
        on another sweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4925"><span data-line="4925"></span>It was three or four months after they were married.  They
        had  lost their way on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They
        had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes,  but
        they  took  a  wrong  turning,  and  presently found themselves
        pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry.  It  was  a
        sheer  drop  of  ten  or  twenty  metres,  with boulders at the
        bottom. There was nobody of whom they could  ask  the  way.  As
        soon  as she realized that they were lost Katharine became very
        uneasy. To be away from the noisy mob  of  hikers  even  for  a
        moment  gave her a feeling of wrong-doing. She wanted to hurry
        back by the way they had come and start searching in the  other
        direction.  But  at  this  moment Winston noticed some tufts of
        loosestrife growing in the cracks of the  cliff  beneath  them.
        One  tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red, apparently
        growing on the same root. He had never  seen  anything  of  the
        kind before, and he called to Katharine to come and look at it.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4942"><span data-line="4942"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Look,  Katharine! Look at those flowers. That clump down
        near the bottom. Do you see they&#39;re two different colours?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4943"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4945"><span data-line="4945"></span>She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully
        come back for a moment. She even leaned out over the cliff face
        to see where he was pointing. He was standing a  little  behind
        her,  and  he  put his hand on her waist to steady her. At this
        moment it suddenly occurred to him how  completely  alone  they
        were.  There  was  not  a  human  creature anywhere, not a leaf
        stirring, not even a bird awake.  In  a  place  like  this  the
        danger  that there would be a hidden microphone was very small,
        and even if there was  a  microphone  it  would  only  pick  up
        sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon. The
        sun  blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his face. And the
        thought struck him …
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4958"><span data-line="4958"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Why didn&#39;t you give her a good  shove?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4958"></span>  said  Julia.  <span data-line="4958"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I
        would have.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4959"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4961"><span data-line="4961"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,  dear, you would have. I would, if I&#39;d been the same
        person then as I  am  now.  Or  perhaps  I  would  —  I&#39;m  not
        certain.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4963"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4965"><span data-line="4965"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Are you sorry you didn&#39;t?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4965"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4967"><span data-line="4967"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes. On the whole I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4967"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4969"><span data-line="4969"></span>They  were  sitting  side  by  side on the dusty floor. He
        pulled her closer against him. Her head rested on his shoulder,
        the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon dung.  She
        was  very  young, he thought, she still expected something from
        life, she did not  understand  that  to  push  an  inconvenient
        person over a cliff solves nothing.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4976"><span data-line="4976"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Actually it would have made no difference,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4976"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4978"><span data-line="4978"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Then why are you sorry you didn&#39;t do it?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4978"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4980"><span data-line="4980"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Only  because  I prefer a positive to a negative. In this
        game that we&#39;re playing, we can&#39;t win. Some  kinds  of  failure
        are better than other kinds, that&#39;s all.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4982"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4984"><span data-line="4984"></span>He  felt  her  shoulders  give  a  wriggle of dissent. She
        always contradicted him when he said anything of this kind. She
        would not accept it as a law of nature that the  individual  is
        always  defeated.  In  a  way she realized that she herself was
        doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police would catch her
        and kill her, but with another part of her  mind  she  believed
        that  it  was  somehow  possible to construct a secret world in
        which you could live as you chose. All you needed was luck  and
        cunning  and boldness. She did not understand that there was no
        such thing as happiness, that the only victory lay in  the  far
        future,  long  after  you  were  dead,  that from the moment of
        declaring war on the Party it was better to think  of  yourself
        as a corpse.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="4998"><span data-line="4998"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We are the dead,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="4998"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5000"><span data-line="5000"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We&#39;re not dead yet,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5000"></span> said Julia prosaically.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5002"><span data-line="5002"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Not  physically.  Six  months,  a  year  —  five  years,
        conceivably. I am afraid of death. You are young, so presumably
        you&#39;re more afraid of it than I am. Obviously we shall  put  it
        off  as long as we can. But it makes very little difference. So
        long as human beings stay human, death and life  are  the  same
        thing.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5007"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5009"><span data-line="5009"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oh,  rubbish!  Which would you sooner sleep with, me or a
        skeleton? Don&#39;t you enjoy being alive? Don&#39;t you like  feeling:
        This  is  me,  this  is  my hand, this is my leg, I&#39;m real, I&#39;m
        solid, I&#39;m alive! Don&#39;t you like this?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5012"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5014"><span data-line="5014"></span>She twisted herself round and pressed  her  bosom  against
        him.  He  could  feel  her  breasts, ripe yet firm, through her
        overalls. Her body seemed to be pouring some of its  youth  and
        vigour into his.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5019"><span data-line="5019"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes, I like that,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5019"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5021"><span data-line="5021"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Then  stop  talking  about  dying.  And now listen, dear,
        we&#39;ve got to fix up about the next time we meet. We may as well
        go back to the place in the wood. We&#39;ve given it  a  good  long
        rest. But you must get there by a different way this time. I&#39;ve
        got  it  all  planned out. You take the train — but look, I&#39;ll
        draw it out for you.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5026"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5028"><span data-line="5028"></span>And in her practical way  she  scraped  together  a  small
        square  of  dust,  and  with  a twig from a pigeon<span data-line="5029"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5029"></span>s nest began
        drawing a map on the floor.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="5034"><span data-line="5034"></span>Winston looked round  the  shabby  little  room  above  Mr
        Charrington<span data-line="5035"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5035"></span>s shop. Beside the window the enormous bed was made
        up,   with   ragged  blankets  and  a  coverless  bolster.  The
        old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was ticking  away
        on  the  mantelpiece.  In the corner, on the gateleg table, the
        glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed
        softly out of the half-darkness.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5042"><span data-line="5042"></span>In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and
        two cups, provided by Mr Charrington. Winston  lit  the  burner
        and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought an envelope full
        of  Victory  Coffee  and  some  saccharine tablets. The clock<span data-line="5045"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5045"></span>s
        hands said seventeen-twenty: it was  nineteen-twenty  really.
        She was coming at nineteen-thirty.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5049"><span data-line="5049"></span>Folly,   folly,   his   heart   kept   saying:  conscious,
        gratuitous, suicidal folly. Of all  the  crimes  that  a  Party
        member  could  commit,  this  one  was  the  least  possible to
        conceal. Actually the idea had first floated into his  head  in
        the  form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the
        surface  of  the  gateleg  table.  As  he  had   foreseen,   Mr
        Charrington  had  made no difficulty about letting the room. He
        was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring  him.
        Nor  did  he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it
        was made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose  of
        a  love-affair.  Instead he looked into the middle distance and
        spoke in generalities, with so delicate an air as to  give  the
        impression  that  he  had  become partly invisible. Privacy, he
        said, was a very valuable thing. Everyone wanted a place  where
        they  could  be  alone  occasionally.  And when they had such a
        place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who  knew  of
        it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming almost to
        fade  out  of existence as he did so, added that there were two
        entries to the house, one of them through the back yard,  which
        gave on an alley.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5070"><span data-line="5070"></span>Under the window somebody was singing. Winston peeped out,
        secure  in  the  protection of the muslin curtain. The June sun
        was still high in the sky, and in the sun-filled court below, a
        monstrous woman, solid as a  Norman  pillar,  with  brawny  red
        forearms  and  a  sacking  apron strapped about her middle, was
        stumping to and fro between  a  washtub  and  a  clothes  line,
        pegging  out  a  series  of  square  white things which Winston
        recognized as babies<span data-line="5077"></span>_<span data-line="5077"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5077"></span>  diapers.  Whenever  her  mouth  was  not
        corked  with  clothes  pegs  she  was  singing  in  a  powerful
        contralto:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="5081" style="display:block"><code>         It was only an &#39;_opeless fancy.
         It passed like an Ipril dye,
         But a look an_&#39; a word an_&#39; the dreams they stirred!
         They &#39;ave stolen my &#39;_eart awye!</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="5086"><span data-line="5086"></span>The tune had been haunting London for weeks past.  It  was
        one of countless similar songs published for the benefit of the
        proles  by  a sub-section of the Music Department. The words of
        these  songs  were  composed  without  any  human  intervention
        whatever  on  an  instrument  known  as a versificator. But the
        woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an
        almost pleasant sound. He could hear the woman singing and  the
        scrape  of  her  shoes  on the flagstones, and the cries of the
        children in the street, and somewhere in  the  far  distance  a
        faint  roar  of  traffic,  and  yet  the  room seemed curiously
        silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5098"><span data-line="5098"></span>Folly,  folly,   folly!   he   thought   again.   It   was
        inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than
        a  few weeks without being caught. But the temptation of having
        a hiding-place that was truly their own, indoors  and  near  at
        hand,  had  been too much for both of them. For some time after
        their visit to the church belfry  it  had  been  impossible  to
        arrange  meetings. Working hours had been drastically increased
        in anticipation of Hate Week. It was more than a month distant,
        but the enormous, complex preparations that  it  entailed  were
        throwing  extra  work  on  to  everybody.  Finally both of them
        managed to secure a free afternoon on the same  day.  They  had
        agreed  to  go back to the clearing in the wood. On the evening
        beforehand they met briefly in the street.  As  usual,  Winston
        hardly  looked  at Julia as they drifted towards one another in
        the crowd, but from the short glance he gave her it  seemed  to
        him that she was paler than usual.

<p class="p indent" data-line="5115"><span data-line="5115"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s all off,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5115"></span> she murmured as soon as she judged it safe
        to speak. <span data-line="5116"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Tomorrow, I mean.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5116"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5118"><span data-line="5118"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5118"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5120"><span data-line="5120"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Tomorrow afternoon. I can&#39;t come.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5120"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5122"><span data-line="5122"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Why not?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5122"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5124"><span data-line="5124"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oh, the usual reason. It&#39;s started early this time.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5124"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5126"><span data-line="5126"></span>For a moment he was violently angry. During the month that
        he had  known her the nature of his desire for her had changed.
        At the beginning there had been little true sensuality  in  it.
        Their first love-making had been simply an act of the will. But
        after  the second time it was different. The smell of her hair,
        the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed to  have
        got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become a
        physical  necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt
        that he had a right to. When she said that she could not  come,
        he  had the feeling that she was cheating him. But just at this
        moment  the  crowd  pressed  them  together  and  their   hands
        accidentally  met.  She  gave  the  tips of his fingers a quick
        squeeze that seemed to invite  not  desire  but  affection.  It
        struck  him  that  when  one lived with a woman this particular
        disappointment must be a normal, recurring event;  and  a  deep
        tenderness,  such  as  he had not felt for her before, suddenly
        took hold of him. He wished that they were a married couple  of
        ten years<span data-line="5143"></span>_<span data-line="5143"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5143"></span> standing. He wished that he were walking through the
        streets  with  her  just  as they were doing now but openly and
        without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and  ends
        for the household. He wished above all that they had some place
        where   they  could  be  alone  together  without  feeling  the
        obligation to make  love  every  time  they  met.  It  was  not
        actually at that moment, but at some time on the following day,
        that  the idea of renting Mr Charrington<span data-line="5150"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5150"></span>s room had occurred to
        him. When  he  suggested  it  to  Julia  she  had  agreed  with
        unexpected  readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It
        was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to  their
        graves.  As  he  sat  waiting on the edge of the bed he thought
        again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love.  It  was  curious
        how   that  predestined  horror  moved  in  and  out  of  one<span data-line="5156"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5156"></span>s
        consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future  times,  preceding
        death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but
        one  could  perhaps postpone it: and yet instead, every now and
        again, by a conscious, wilful act, one  chose  to  shorten  the
        interval before it happened.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5163"><span data-line="5163"></span>At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia
        burst  into  the  room.  She  was carrying a tool-bag of coarse
        brown canvas, such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and
        fro at the Ministry. He started forward  to  take  her  in  his
        arms,  but  she  disengaged  herself  rather  hurriedly, partly
        because she was still holding the tool-bag.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5170"><span data-line="5170"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Half a second,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5170"></span> she said. <span data-line="5170"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Just let me show you what I&#39;ve
        brought. Did you bring some of that filthy  Victory  Coffee?  I
        thought  you  would.  You  can  chuck it away again, because we
        shan&#39;t be needing it. Look here.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5173"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5175"><span data-line="5175"></span>She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out
        some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it.
        Underneath were a number  of  neat  paper  packets.  The  first
        packet that she passed to Winston had a strange and yet vaguely
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="5181" style="display:block"><code>    familiar  feeling.  It  was  filled  with  some  kind of heavy,
    sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it.</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="5184"><span data-line="5184"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It isn&#39;t sugar?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5184"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5186"><span data-line="5186"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here&#39;s a  loaf  of
        bread  proper white bread, not our bloody stuff — and a little
        pot of jam. And here&#39;s a tin of milk — but look! This  is  the
        one  I&#39;m  really proud of. I had to wrap a bit of sacking round
        it, because-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5190"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5192"><span data-line="5192"></span>But she did not need to tell him why she  had  wrapped  it
        up.  The  smell  was already filling the room, a rich hot smell
        which seemed like an emanation from his  early  childhood,  but
        which  one  did occasionally meet with even now, blowing down a
        passage-way  before  a  door  slammed,  or   diffusing   itself
        mysteriously  in  a  crowded street, sniffed for an instant and
        then lost again.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5200"><span data-line="5200"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s coffee,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5200"></span> he murmured, <span data-line="5200"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">real coffee.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5200"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5202"><span data-line="5202"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5202"></span>_<span data-line="5202"></span>It<span data-line="5202"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5202"></span>s Inner Party coffee. There<span data-line="5202"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5202"></span>s a whole kilo  here,  she
        said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5205"><span data-line="5205"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">How did you manage to get hold of all these things?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5205"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5207"><span data-line="5207"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s  all  Inner Party stuff. There&#39;s nothing those swine
        don&#39;t have, nothing. But of course  waiters  and  servants  and
        people  pinch things, and — look, I got a little packet of tea
        as well.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5210"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5212"><span data-line="5212"></span>Winston had squatted down  beside  her.  He  tore  open  a
        corner of the packet.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5215"><span data-line="5215"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s real tea. Not blackberry leaves.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5215"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5217"><span data-line="5217"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There&#39;s  been a lot of tea about lately. They&#39;ve captured
        India, or something,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5218"></span> she said vaguely. <span data-line="5218"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But  listen,  dear.  I
        want  you to turn your back on me for three minutes. Go and sit
        on the other side of the bed. Don&#39;t go too near the window. And
        don&#39;t turn round till I tell you.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5221"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5223"><span data-line="5223"></span>Winston gazed abstractedly  through  the  muslin  curtain.
        Down  in the yard the red-armed woman was still marching to and
        fro between the washtub and the line. She took  two  more  pegs
        out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="5228" style="display:block"><code>         They sye that time &#39;_eals all things,
         They sye you can always forget;
         But the smiles an_&#39; the tears acrorss the years
         They twist my &#39;_eart-strings yet!</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="5233"><span data-line="5233"></span>She  knew  the  whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed.
        Her voice floated  upward  with  the  sweet  summer  air,  very
        tuneful,  charged  with a sort of happy melancholy. One had the
        feeling that she would have been perfectly content, if the June
        evening  had  been  endless   and   the   supply   of   clothes
        inexhaustible,  to  remain  there for a thousand years, pegging
        out diapers and singing rubbish. It struck  him  as  a  curious
        fact  that  he  had  never  heard a member of the Party singing
        alone and spontaneously. It would  even  have  seemed  slightly
        unorthodox,  a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to oneself.
        Perhaps it  was  only  when  people  were  somewhere  near  the
        starvation level that they had anything to sing about.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5246"><span data-line="5246"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You can turn round now,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5246"></span> said Julia.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5248"><span data-line="5248"></span>He  turned  round,  and  for  a  second  almost  failed to
        recognize her. What he had actually expected  was  to  see  her
        naked.  But  she  was  not  naked.  The transformation that had
        happened was much more surprising than that.  She  had  painted
        her face.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5254"><span data-line="5254"></span>She  must  have  slipped into some shop in the proletarian
        quarters  and  bought  herself  a  complete  set   of   make-up
        materials.  Her  lips  were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged,
        her nose powdered; there was even a touch  of  something  under
        the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done,
        but  Winston<span data-line="5259"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5259"></span>s  standards in such matters were not high. He had
        never before seen  or  imagined  a  woman  of  the  Party  with
        cosmetics  on  her  face. The improvement in her appearance was
        startling. With just a few dabs of colour in the  right  places
        she had become not only very much prettier, but, above all, far
        more  feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added
        to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave  of  synthetic
        violets  flooded his nostrils. He remembered the half-darkness
        of a basement kitchen, and a woman<span data-line="5267"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5267"></span>s cavernous  mouth.  It  was
        the very same scent that she had used; but at the moment it did
        not seem to matter.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5271"><span data-line="5271"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Scent too!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5271"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5273"><span data-line="5273"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,  dear,  scent too. And do you know what I&#39;m going to
        do next? I&#39;m going to get hold of a  real  woman&#39;s  frock  from
        somewhere  and  wear  it instead of these bloody trousers. I&#39;ll
        wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes!  In  this  room  I&#39;m
        going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5277"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5279"><span data-line="5279"></span>They  flung  their  clothes  off and climbed into the huge
        mahogany bed. It was  the  first  time  that  he  had  stripped
        himself  naked  in her presence. Until now he had been too much
        ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with  the  varicose  veins
        standing  out  on his calves and the discoloured patch over his
        ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket they  lay  on  was
        threadbare  and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed
        astonished both of them. <span data-line="5286"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s sure to be full of bugs, but who
        cares?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5287"></span> said Julia. One never saw a double bed nowadays, except
        in the homes of the proles. Winston had occasionally  slept  in
        one  in his boyhood: Julia had never been in one before, so far
        as she could remember.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5292"><span data-line="5292"></span>Presently they  fell  asleep  for  a  little  while.  When
        Winston  woke  up  the  hands  of  the clock had crept round to
        nearly nine. He did not stir, because Julia was  sleeping  with
        her  head  in  the  crook  of  his arm. Most of her make-up had
        transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a  light
        stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A
        yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed
        and  lighted  up  the fireplace, where the water in the pan was
        boiling fast. Down in the yard the woman had  stopped  singing,
        but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street. He
        wondered  vaguely  whether  in the abolished past it had been a
        normal experience to lie in bed like this, in  the  cool  of  a
        summer  evening,  a  man and a woman with no clothes on, making
        love when they chose, talking of what they chose,  not  feeling
        any  compulsion  to get up, simply lying there and listening to
        peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could never have  been  a
        time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbed her eyes,
        and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.

        and make some coffee in another moment. We&#39;ve got an hour. What

<p class="p indent" data-line="5315"><span data-line="5315"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Twenty-three thirty.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5315"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5317"><span data-line="5317"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to  get  in

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5320"><span data-line="5320"></span>She  suddenly  twisted  herself  over in the bed, seized a
        shoe from the floor, and sent it hurtling into the corner  with
        a  boyish jerk of her arm, exactly as he had seen her fling the
        dictionary at Goldstein, that morning during  the  Two  Minutes
        Hate.

<p class="p indent" data-line="5326"><span data-line="5326"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What was it?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5326"></span> he said in surprise.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5328"><span data-line="5328"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">A  rat.  I  saw  him  stick  his  beastly nose out of the
        wainscoting. There&#39;s a hole down  there.  I  gave  him  a  good
        fright, anyway.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5330"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5332"><span data-line="5332"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Rats!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5332"></span> murmured Winston. <span data-line="5332"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">In this room!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5332"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5334"><span data-line="5334"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They&#39;re  all over the place,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5334"></span> said Julia indifferently as
        she lay down again. <span data-line="5335"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We&#39;ve even got them in the kitchen at  the
        hostel.  Some  parts  of London are swarming with them. Did you
        know they attack children? Yes,  they  do.  In  some  of  these
        streets  a  woman  daren&#39;t  leave a baby alone for two minutes.
        It&#39;s the great huge brown ones that do it. And the nasty  thing
        is that the brutes always-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5340"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5342"><span data-line="5342"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Don&#39;t  go on!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5342"></span> said Winston, with his eyes tightly
        shut.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5345"><span data-line="5345"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Dearest! You&#39;ve gone quite pale. What&#39;s  the  matter?  Do
        they make you feel sick?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5346"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5348"><span data-line="5348"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Of all horrors in the world — a rat!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5348"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5350"><span data-line="5350"></span>She  pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round
        him, as though to reassure him with the warmth of her body.  He
        did not reopen his eyes immediately. For several moments he had
        had the feeling of being back in a nightmare which had recurred
        from  time to time throughout his life. It was always very much
        the same. He was standing in front of a wall of  darkness,  and
        on  the  other  side  of  it  there  was something unendurable,
        something too dreadful to be faced. In the  dream  his  deepest
        feeling  was  always  one of self-deception, because he did in
        fact know what was behind the wall of darkness. With  a  deadly
        effort,  like  wrenching a piece out of his own brain, he could
        even have dragged the thing into the open. He  always  woke  up
        without  discovering  what it was: but somehow it was connected
        with what Julia had been saying when he cut her short.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5365"><span data-line="5365"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;m sorry,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5365"></span> he said, <span data-line="5365"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">it&#39;s nothing. I  don&#39;t  like  rats,
        that&#39;s all.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5366"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5368"><span data-line="5368"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Don&#39;t  worry,  dear,  we&#39;re  not going to have the filthy
        brutes in here. I&#39;ll stuff the  hole  with  a  bit  of  sacking
        before  we  go.  And  next  time  we  come here I&#39;ll bring some
        plaster and bung it up properly.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5371"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5373"><span data-line="5373"></span>Already the black instant  of  panic  was  half-forgotten.
        Feeling  slightly  ashamed  of  himself,  he sat up against the
        bedhead. Julia got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, and made
        the coffee. The smell  that  rose  from  the  saucepan  was  so
        powerful  and  exciting  that they shut the window lest anybody
        outside should notice it and become inquisitive. What was  even
        better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given
        to  it by the sugar, a thing Winston had almost forgotten after
        years of saccharine. With one hand in her pocket and a piece of
        bread and jam in the other,  Julia  wandered  about  the  room,
        glancing  indifferently  at the bookcase, pointing out the best
        way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping  herself  down  in
        the  ragged  arm-chair  to  see  if  it  was  comfortable,  and
        examining the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of  tolerant
        amusement. She brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to
        have  a  look  at  it  in a better light. He took it out of her
        hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft, rainwatery appearance
        of the glass.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5392"><span data-line="5392"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What is it, do you think?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5392"></span> said Julia.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5394"><span data-line="5394"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything-I mean, I don&#39;t think it  was
        ever put to any use. That&#39;s what I like about it. It&#39;s a little
        chunk  of  history  that  they&#39;ve  forgotten  to  alter. It&#39;s a
        message from a hundred years ago, if one knew how to read it.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5397"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5399"><span data-line="5399"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And that  picture  over  there</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5399"></span>  —  she  nodded  at  the
        engraving  on  the opposite wall-<span data-line="5400"></span>&#8216;would that be a hundred years
        old?_&#8217;<span data-line="5401"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5403"><span data-line="5403"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">More. Two hundred, I  dare  say.  One  can&#39;t  tell.  It&#39;s
        impossible to discover the age of anything nowadays.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5404"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5406"><span data-line="5406"></span>She  went  over  to  look  at it. <span data-line="5406"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Here&#39;s where that brute
        stuck  his  nose  out,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5407"></span>  she  said,  kicking  the   wainscoting
        immediately  below  the picture. <span data-line="5408"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What is this place? I&#39;ve seen
        it before somewhere.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5409"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5411"><span data-line="5411"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s a church, or at least it  used  to  be. St Clement&#39;s
        Danes  its name was.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5412"></span> The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington
        had  taught  him  came  back  into  his  head,  and  he   added
        half-nostalgically:  <span data-line="5414"></span>&#8220;Oranges  and  lemons, say the bells of St
        Clement&#39;s!&#8221;<span data-line="5415"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5417"><span data-line="5417"></span>To his astonishment she capped the line:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="5419" style="display:block"><code>         &#39;_You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin&#39;s,
         When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey — &#39;_</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="5422"><span data-line="5422"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5422"></span>_<span data-line="5422"></span>I can<span data-line="5422"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5422"></span>t remember how it goes on after that. But anyway  I
        remember  it ends up, <span data-line="5423"></span>&#8220;Here comes a candle to light you to bed,
        here comes a chopper to chop off your head!&#8221;<span data-line="5424"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5426"><span data-line="5426"></span>It was like the two halves of  a  countersign.  But  there
        must  be  another line after <span data-line="5427"></span>&#8216;_the bells of Old Bailey&#8217;<span data-line="5427"></span>. Perhaps
        it could be dug out of Mr  Charrington<span data-line="5428"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5428"></span>s  memory,  if  he  were
        suitably prompted.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5431"><span data-line="5431"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Who taught you that?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5431"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5433"><span data-line="5433"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">My  grandfather.  He  used  to  say it to me when I was a
        little girl. He was vaporized when I was eight — at any  rate,
        he   disappeared.  I  wonder  what  a  lemon  was,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5435"></span>  she  added
        inconsequently. <span data-line="5436"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;ve seen oranges. They&#39;re  a  kind  of  round
        yellow fruit with a thick skin.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5437"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5439"><span data-line="5439"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  can  remember  lemons,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5439"></span> said Winston. <span data-line="5439"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They were quite
        common in the fifties. They were so sour that it set your teeth
        on edge even to smell them.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5441"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5443"><span data-line="5443"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I bet that picture&#39;s got bugs  behind  it,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5443"></span>  said  Julia.
        <span data-line="5444"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;ll take it down and give it a good clean some day. I suppose
        it&#39;s  almost  time  we  were leaving. I must start washing this
        paint off. What a bore! I&#39;ll get the  lipstick  off  your  face
        afterwards.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5447"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5449"><span data-line="5449"></span>Winston  did  not  get up for a few minutes more. The room
        was darkening. He turned over towards the light and lay  gazing
        into the glass paperweight. The inexhaustibly interesting thing
        was  not  the  fragment  of coral but the interior of the glass
        itself. There was such a depth of it, and yet it was almost  as
        transparent  as  air. It was as though the surface of the glass
        had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world  with  its
        atmosphere  complete.  He  had  the  feeling  that he could get
        inside it, and that in fact he was inside it,  along  with  the
        mahogany bed and the gateleg table, and the clock and the steel
        engraving  and  the paperweight itself. The paperweight was the
        room he was in, and the coral was Julia<span data-line="5460"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5460"></span>s  life  and  his  own,
        fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="5465"><span data-line="5465"></span>Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was missing from
        work: a few thoughtless people commented on his absence. On the
        next day  nobody  mentioned  him. On the third day Winston went
        into the vestibule of the Records Department  to  look  at  the
        notice-board.  One of the notices carried a printed list of the
        members of the Chess Committee, of whom Syme had been  one.  It
        looked  almost  exactly  as it had looked before — nothing had
        been crossed out — but it was one name shorter. It was enough.
        Syme had ceased to exist: he had never existed.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5475"><span data-line="5475"></span>The weather was baking hot. In the  labyrinthine  Ministry
        the   windowless,   air-conditioned  rooms  kept  their  normal
        temperature, but outside the pavements scorched one<span data-line="5477"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5477"></span>s feet  and
        the  stench  of  the  Tubes at the rush hours was a horror. The
        preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and  the  staffs
        of  all  the  Ministries  were  working  overtime. Processions,
        meetings, military parades, lectures, waxworks, displays,  film
        shows,  telescreen  programmes  all had to be organized; stands
        had to  be  erected,  effigies  built,  slogans  coined,  songs
        written, rumours circulated, photographs faked. Julia<span data-line="5484"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5484"></span>s unit in
        the  Fiction  Department  had  been taken off the production of
        novels and was rushing out  a  series  of  atrocity  pamphlets.
        Winston,  in  addition  to his regular work, spent long periods
        every day in going through back files of The  Times  and
        altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in
        speeches. Late at night, when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the
        streets, the town had a curiously febrile air. The rocket bombs
        crashed  oftener  than  ever, and sometimes in the far distance
        there were enormous explosions which no one could  explain  and
        about which there were wild rumours.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5496"><span data-line="5496"></span>The  new  tune which was to be the theme-song of Hate Week
        (the Hate Song, it was called) had already  been  composed  and
        was  being  endlessly  plugged  on  the  telescreens.  It had a
        savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly be called music,
        but resembled the beating of a drum. Roared out by hundreds  of
        voices  to  the  tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying. The
        proles had taken a fancy to it, and in the midnight streets  it
        competed  with  the  still-popular  <span data-line="5503"></span>&#8216;_It  was  only a hopeless
        fancy&#8217;<span data-line="5504"></span>. The Parsons children played it  at  all  hours  of  the
        night  and  day,  unbearably,  on  a comb and a piece of toilet
        paper. Winston<span data-line="5506"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5506"></span>s evenings were  fuller  than  ever.  Squads  of
        volunteers, organized by Parsons, were preparing the street for
        Hate   Week,  stitching  banners,  painting  posters,  erecting
        flagstaffs on the roofs, and perilously slinging  wires  across
        the street for the reception of streamers. Parsons boasted that
        Victory  Mansions  alone  would  display four hundred metres of
        bunting. He was in his native element and as happy as  a  lark.
        The  heat  and the manual work had even given him a pretext for
        reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings.  He  was
        everywhere   at  once,  pushing,  pulling,  sawing,  hammering,
        improvising,   jollying   everyone   along    with    comradely
        exhortations  and  giving  out from every fold of his body what
        seemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid-smelling sweat.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5520"><span data-line="5520"></span>A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. It had
        no caption, and represented simply the monstrous  figure  of  a
        Eurasian  soldier,  three or four metres high, striding forward
        with  expressionless  Mongolian  face  and  enormous  boots,  a
        submachine  gun  pointed  from his hip. From whatever angle you
        looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified  by  the
        foreshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. The thing
        had  been  plastered  on  every blank space on every wall, even
        outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother. The proles, normally
        apathetic about the war, were being lashed into  one  of  their
        periodical  frenzies of patriotism. As though to harmonize with
        the general mood, the rocket  bombs  had  been  killing  larger
        numbers  of  people  than  usual.  One  fell  on a crowded film
        theatre in Stepney, burying several hundred victims  among  the
        ruins. The whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for
        a  long,  trailing  funeral  which went on for hours and was in
        effect an indignation meeting. Another bomb fell on a piece  of
        waste  ground  which was used as a playground and several dozen
        children  were  blown  to  pieces.  There  were  further  angry
        demonstrations,  Goldstein  was  burned  in effigy, hundreds of
        copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and
        added to the flames, and a number of shops were looted  in  the
        turmoil; then a rumour flew round that spies were directing the
        rocket  bombs by means of wireless waves, and an old couple who
        were suspected of being of foreign extraction had  their  house
        set on fire and perished of suffocation.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5547"><span data-line="5547"></span>In  the  room  over Mr Charrington<span data-line="5547"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5547"></span>s shop, when they could
        get there, Julia and Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed
        under the open window, naked for the sake of coolness. The  rat
        had  never  come back, but the bugs had multiplied hideously in
        the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or clean,  the  room
        was  paradise.  As  soon  as  they  arrived they would sprinkle
        everything with pepper bought on the  black  market,  tear  off
        their  clothes,  and  make love with sweating bodies, then fall
        asleep and wake to find that the  bugs  had  rallied  and  were
        massing for the counter-attack.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5558"><span data-line="5558"></span>Four,  five,  six — seven times they met during the month
        of June. Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin  at  all
        hours.  He  seemed  to  have lost the need for it. He had grown
        fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving only  a  brown
        stain  on the skin above his ankle, his fits of coughing in the
        early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceased to be
        intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at  the
        telescreen  or  shout  curses at the top of his voice. Now that
        they had a secure hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even
        seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and  for
        a  couple  of  hours at a time. What mattered was that the room
        over the junk-shop should exist. To know that  it  was  there,
        inviolate,  was  almost the same as being in it. The room was a
        world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals  could  walk.
        Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal. He
        usually  stopped  to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes
        on his way upstairs. The old man seemed seldom or never  to  go
        out  of  doors,  and  on  the  other  hand  to  have  almost no
        customers. He led a ghostlike existence between the tiny,  dark
        shop,  and  an  even  tinier back kitchen where he prepared his
        meals and which contained, among other things, an  unbelievably
        ancient gramophone with an enormous horn. He seemed glad of the
        opportunity to talk. Wandering about among his worthless stock,
        with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders
        in  the velvet jacket, he had always vaguely the air of being a
        collector rather  than  a  tradesman.  With  a  sort  of  faded
        enthusiasm  he  would finger this scrap of rubbish or that — a
        china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken  snuffbox,  a
        pinchbeck  locket  containing a strand of some long-dead baby<span data-line="5586"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5586"></span>s
        hair — never asking that Winston should buy it, merely that he
        should admire it. To talk to him  was  like  listening  to  the
        tinkling of a worn-out musical-box. He had dragged out from the
        corners  of his memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes.
        There was one about four and  twenty  blackbirds,  and  another
        about  a  cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death
        of poor Cock Robin. <span data-line="5593"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It  just  occurred  to  me  you  might  be
        interested,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5594"></span>  he  would  say  with  a  deprecating little laugh
        whenever he produced a new fragment. But he could never  recall
        more than a few lines of any one rhyme.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5598"><span data-line="5598"></span>Both  of  them  knew-in  a  way, it was never out of their
        minds that what was now happening could not  last  long.  There
        were  times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable
        as the bed they lay on, and they would cling  together  with  a
        sort  of  despairing sensuality, like a damned soul grasping at
        his last morsel of pleasure  when  the  clock  is  within  five
        minutes  of  striking.  But there were also times when they had
        the illusion not only of safety but of permanence. So  long  as
        they  were actually in this room, they both felt, no harm could
        come to them. Getting there was difficult  and  dangerous,  but
        the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when Winston had gazed
        into  the  heart  of  the paperweight, with the feeling that it
        would be possible to get inside that  glassy  world,  and  that
        once  inside  it  time  could  be  arrested.  Often  they  gave
        themselves up to daydreams of escape.  Their  luck  would  hold
        indefinitely, and they would carry on their intrigue, just like
        this,  for  the  remainder of their natural lives. Or Katharine
        would die, and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and  Julia  would
        succeed  in  getting  married.  Or  they  would  commit suicide
        together. Or they would  disappear,  alter  themselves  out  of
        recognition,  learn to speak with proletarian accents, get jobs
        in  a  factory  and  live  out  their  lives  undetected  in  a
        back-street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew. In reality
        there  was  no  escape. Even the one plan that was practicable,
        suicide, they had no intention of carrying out. To hang on from
        day to day and from week to week, spinning out a  present  that
        had  no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one<span data-line="5624"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5624"></span>s
        lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is  air
        available.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5628"><span data-line="5628"></span>Sometimes,   too,   they  talked  of  engaging  in  active
        rebellion against the Party, but with no notion of how to  take
        the first step. Even if the fabulous Brotherhood was a reality,
        there  still  remained the difficulty of finding one<span data-line="5631"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5631"></span>s way into
        it. He told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or seemed
        to exist, between himself and O<span data-line="5633"></span>&#8216;Brien, and of  the  impulse  he
        sometimes   felt,  simply  to  walk  into  O&#39;Brien&#39;s  presence,
        announce that he was the enemy of the  Party,  and  demand  his
        help.   Curiously  enough,  this  did  not  strike  her  as  an
        impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to judging people  by
        their  faces,  and it seemed natural to her that Winston should
        believe O&#39;Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of  a  single
        flash  of  the  eyes.  Moreover  she  took  it for granted that
        everyone, or nearly everyone,  secretly  hated  the  Party  and
        would  break  the rules if he thought it safe to do so. But she
        refused  to  believe  that  widespread,  organized   opposition
        existed  or  could  exist.  The  tales  about Goldstein and his
        underground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish  which
        the  Party  had invented for its own purposes and which you had
        to pretend to believe in. Times beyond number, at Party rallies
        and spontaneous demonstrations, she had shouted at the  top  of
        her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never
        heard  and  in  whose  supposed crimes she had not the faintest
        belief. When public trials were happening  she  had  taken  her
        place  in  the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded
        the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals  &#8217;<span data-line="5653"></span><em class="em-low1">Death
        to  the  traitors!</em><span data-line="5654"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5654"></span>  During  the  Two  Minutes  Hate she always
        excelled all others in shouting insults at Goldstein.  Yet  she
        had  only  the  dimmest  idea  of  who  Goldstein  was and what
        doctrines he was supposed to represent. She had grown up  since
        the  Revolution  and  was too young to remember the ideological
        battles of  the  fifties  and  sixties.  Such  a  thing  as  an
        independent political movement was outside her imagination: and
        in  any  case  the Party was invincible. It would always exist,
        and it would always be the same. You could only  rebel  against
        it  by  secret  disobedience  or,  at most, by isolated acts of
        violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5666"><span data-line="5666"></span>In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and  far
        less  susceptible to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in
        some connexion to mention the war against Eurasia, she startled
        him by saying casually that in her  opinion  the  war  was  not
        happening.  The  rocket  bombs  which fell daily on London were
        probably fired by the Government of Oceania  itself,  <span data-line="5671"></span>&#8216;_just  to
        keep  people  frightened&#8217;<span data-line="5672"></span>.  This was an idea that had literally
        never occurred to him. She also stirred a sort of envy  in  him
        by  telling  him  that  during  the  Two Minutes Hate her great
        difficulty was to avoid bursting out  laughing.  But  she  only
        questioned  the  teachings  of  the Party when they in some way
        touched upon her own life. Often she was ready  to  accept  the
        official mythology, simply because the difference between truth
        and  falsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for
        instance, having learnt  it  at  school,  that  the  Party  had
        invented   aeroplanes.   (In   his   own   schooldays,  Winston
        remembered, in the late fifties, it  was  only  the  helicopter
        that  the  Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later,
        when  Julia  was  at  school,  it  was  already  claiming   the
        aeroplane;  one  generation  more, and it would be claiming the
        steam engine.) And when he told her that aeroplanes had been in
        existence before he was born and long  before  the  Revolution,
        the  fact  struck her as totally uninteresting. After all, what
        did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was  rather  more
        of  a  shock  to him when he discovered from some chance remark
        that she did not remember that Oceania,  four  years  ago,  had
        been  at  war  with  Eastasia and at peace with Eurasia. It was
        true that she regarded the whole war as a sham: but  apparently
        she  had  not  even  noticed  that  the  name  of the enemy had
        changed. <span data-line="5695"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I thought we&#39;d always been at war with Eurasia,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5695"></span>  she
        said  vaguely.  It  frightened  him  a little. The invention of
        aeroplanes dated from long before her birth, but the switchover
        in the war had happened only four years ago, well after she was
        grown up. He argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter  of
        an  hour.  In  the  end he succeeded in forcing her memory back
        until she did dimly recall that at one time  Eastasia  and  not
        Eurasia  had  been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as
        unimportant. <span data-line="5703"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Who cares?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5703"></span> she said  impatiently.  <span data-line="5703"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5703"></span>_<span data-line="5703"></span>It<span data-line="5703"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5703"></span>s  always
        one  bloody  war  after  another, and one knows the news is all
        lies anyway.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5707"><span data-line="5707"></span>Sometimes he talked to her of the Records  Department  and
        the impudent forgeries that he committed there. Such things did
        not  appear  to horrify her. She did not feel the abyss opening
        beneath her feet at the thought of  lies  becoming  truths.  He
        told  her  the story of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford and the
        momentous slip of paper which he  had  once  held  between  his
        fingers.  It  did  not  make  much impression on her. At first,
        indeed, she failed to grasp the point of the story.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5716"><span data-line="5716"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Were they friends of yours?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5716"></span> she said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5718"><span data-line="5718"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No, I never knew them. They  were  Inner  Party  members.
        Besides,  they  were far older men than I was. They belonged to
        the old days, before the Revolution.  I  barely  knew  them  by
        sight.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5721"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5723"><span data-line="5723"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Then  what  was  there  to  worry about? People are being
        killed off all the time, aren&#39;t they?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5724"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5726"><span data-line="5726"></span>He tried to make her understand. <span data-line="5726"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">This was an  exceptional
        case.  It  wasn&#39;t  just a question of somebody being killed. Do
        you realize that the past, starting from  yesterday,  has  been
        actually  abolished?  If  it  survives  anywhere, it&#39;s in a few
        solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of
        glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about the
        Revolution and the years before the  Revolution.  Every  record
        has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten,
        every  picture  has been repainted, every statue and street and
        building has been renamed, every date  has  been  altered.  And
        that  process  is  continuing  day by day and minute by minute.
        History has stopped. Nothing exists except an  endless  present
        in  which  the Party is always right. I know, of course,
        that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible  for
        me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself. After
        the  thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence
        is inside my own mind, and I don&#39;t know with any certainty that
        any other human being shares my  memories.  Just  in  that  one
        instance,  in  my  whole  life,  I  did possess actual concrete
        evidence after the event — years after it.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5745"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5747"><span data-line="5747"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And what good was that?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5747"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5749"><span data-line="5749"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It was no good, because I threw it  away  a  few  minutes
        later. But if the same thing happened today, I should keep it.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5750"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5752"><span data-line="5752"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Well,  I  wouldn&#39;t!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5752"></span> said Julia. <span data-line="5752"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;m quite ready to take
        risks, but only for something worth while, not for bits of  old
        newspaper.  What  could  you  have done with it even if you had
        kept it?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5755"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5757"><span data-line="5757"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Not much, perhaps. But it was  evidence.  It  might  have
        planted  a  few doubts here and there, supposing that I&#39;d dared
        to show it to anybody.  I  don&#39;t  imagine  that  we  can  alter
        anything  in our own lifetime. But one can imagine little knots
        of resistance springing up here and there —  small  groups  of
        people  banding themselves together, and gradually growing, and
        even leaving a few records behind, so that the next generations
        can carry on where we leave off.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5764"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5766"><span data-line="5766"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5766"></span>_<span data-line="5766"></span>I<span data-line="5766"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5766"></span>m not interested in  the  next  generation,  dear.  I<span data-line="5766"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5766"></span>m
        interested in us.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5769"><span data-line="5769"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You&#39;re  only  a  rebel from the waist downwards,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5769"></span> he told
        her.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5772"><span data-line="5772"></span>She thought this brilliantly  witty  and  flung  her  arms
        round him in delight.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5775"><span data-line="5775"></span>In  the  ramifications  of  party doctrine she had not the
        faintest interest. Whenever he began to talk of the  principles
        of  Ingsoc,  doublethink,  the  mutability of the past, and the
        denial of objective reality, and to  use  Newspeak  words,  she
        became  bored  and  confused  and  said that she never paid any
        attention to that kind of thing.  One  knew  that  it  was  all
        rubbish,  so why let oneself be worried by it? She knew when to
        cheer and when to boo, and that  was  all  one  needed.  If  he
        persisted  in talking of such subjects, she had a disconcerting
        habit of falling asleep. She was one of those people who can go
        to sleep at any hour and in any position. Talking  to  her,  he
        realized  how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy
        while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy  meant.  In  a
        way,   the   world-view   of  the  Party  imposed  itself  most
        successfully on people  incapable  of  understanding  it.  They
        could  be  made  to  accept  the  most  flagrant  violations of
        reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of  what
        was  demanded  of them, and were not sufficiently interested in
        public  events  to  notice  what  was  happening.  By  lack  of
        understanding   they   remained  sane.  They  simply  swallowed
        everything, and what they swallowed did them no  harm,  because
        it  left  no  residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass
        undigested through the body of a bird.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="5801"><span data-line="5801"></span>It had happened at last. The expected  message  had  come.
        All his life, it seemed to him, he had been waiting for this to
        happen.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5805"><span data-line="5805"></span>He  was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and
        he was almost at the spot where Julia had slipped the note into
        his hand when he became aware that someone larger than  himself
        was walking just behind him. The person, whoever it was, gave a
        small  cough,  evidently  as  a  prelude  to  speaking. Winston
        stopped abruptly and turned. It was O<span data-line="5810"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5810"></span>Brien.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5812"><span data-line="5812"></span>At last they were face to face, and  it  seemed  that  his
        only  impulse  was to run away. His heart bounded violently. He
        would have been incapable of speaking.  O<span data-line="5814"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5814"></span>Brien,  however,  had
        continued  forward in the same movement, laying a friendly hand
        for a moment on Winston<span data-line="5816"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5816"></span>s arm, so that the  two  of  them  were
        walking side by side. He began speaking with the peculiar grave
        courtesy  that  differentiated  him  from the majority of Inner
        Party members.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5821"><span data-line="5821"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to  you,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5821"></span>
        he said. <span data-line="5822"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I was reading one of your Newspeak articles in The
        Times  the  other  day.  You  take  a scholarly interest in
        Newspeak, I believe?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5824"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5826"><span data-line="5826"></span>Winston had recovered part of his self-possession. <span data-line="5826"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Hardly
        scholarly,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5827"></span> he said. <span data-line="5827"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;m only an amateur. It&#39;s not my subject.
        I have never had anything to do with the actual construction of
        the language.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5829"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5831"><span data-line="5831"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But you write it very elegantly,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5831"></span> said O<span data-line="5831"></span>&#8216;Brien. &#8217;<span data-line="5831"></span><em class="em-low1">That  is
        not  only my own opinion. I was talking recently to a friend of
        yours who is certainly an  expert.  His  name  has  slipped  my
        memory for the moment.</em><span data-line="5834"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5834"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5836"><span data-line="5836"></span>Again   Winston<span data-line="5836"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5836"></span>s   heart   stirred   painfully.   It  was
        inconceivable that this was anything other than a reference  to
        Syme.  But  Syme  was  not  only  dead,  he  was  abolished, an
        unperson. Any identifiable reference to him  would  have
        been  mortally  dangerous. O<span data-line="5840"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5840"></span>Brien<span data-line="5840"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5840"></span>s remark must obviously have
        been intended as a signal, a codeword. By sharing a  small  act
        of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices.
        They  had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor, but now
        O<span data-line="5844"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5844"></span>Brien halted. With the curious, disarming  friendliness  that
        he  always  managed  to  put in to the gesture he resettled his
        spectacles on his nose. Then he went on:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5848"><span data-line="5848"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What I had really  intended  to  say  was  that  in  your
        article  I  noticed  you  had  used two words which have become
        obsolete. But they have only become so very recently. Have  you
        seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak Dictionary?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5851"></span>

<p class="p indent" data-line="5853"><span data-line="5853"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5853"></span>  said  Winston.  <span data-line="5853"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  didn&#39;t think it had been issued

<p class="p indent" data-line="5856"><span data-line="5856"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months, I
        believe. But a few advance copies have been circulated. I  have
        one myself. It might interest you to look at it, perhaps?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5858"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5860"><span data-line="5860"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Very  much  so,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5860"></span>  said  Winston, immediately seeing where
        this tended.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5863"><span data-line="5863"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Some of the new  developments  are  most  ingenious.  The
        reduction in the number of verbs — that is the point that will
        appeal to you, I think. Let me see, shall I send a messenger to
        you  with  the  dictionary? But I am afraid I invariably forget
        anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick it up at my  flat

        address.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5869"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5871"><span data-line="5871"></span>They were standing in  front  of  a  telescreen.  Somewhat
        absentmindedly  O<span data-line="5872"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5872"></span>Brien  felt  two  of  his  pockets  and  then
        produced a small  leather-covered  notebook  and  a  gold<span data-line="5873"></span><br>
<span data-line="5874"></span>        ink-pencil.  Immediately beneath the telescreen, in such a position
        that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument
        could read what he was writing, he scribbled an  address,  tore
        out the page and handed it to Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5879"><span data-line="5879"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  am usually at home in the evenings,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5879"></span> he said. <span data-line="5879"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">If not,
        my servant will give you the dictionary.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5880"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5882"><span data-line="5882"></span>He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap  of  paper,
        which  this  time there was no need to conceal. Nevertheless he
        carefully memorized what was written  on  it,  and  some  hours
        later  dropped  it  into  the  memory hole along with a mass of
        other papers.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5888"><span data-line="5888"></span>They had been talking to  one  another  for  a  couple  of
        minutes  at  the  most.  There  was  only  one meaning that the
        episode could possibly have. It had been contrived as a way  of
        letting  Winston  know  O<span data-line="5891"></span>&#8216;Brien&#39;s  address. This was necessary,
        because except by direct  enquiry  it  was  never  possible  to
        discover  where  anyone lived. There were no directories of any
        kind. &#8217;<span data-line="5894"></span><em class="em-low1">If you ever want to see me,  this  is  where  I  can  be
        found,</em><span data-line="5895"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5895"></span>  was what O<span data-line="5895"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5895"></span>Brien had been saying to him. Perhaps there
        would even be a message concealed somewhere in the  dictionary.
        But  at any rate, one thing was certain. The conspiracy that he
        had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached the outer edges of
        it.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5901"><span data-line="5901"></span>He knew that sooner  or  later  he  would  obey  O<span data-line="5901"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5901"></span>Brien<span data-line="5901"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5901"></span>s
        summons. Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay — he was
        not  certain.  What was happening was only the working-out of a
        process that had started years ago. The first step had  been  a
        secret, involuntary thought, the second had been the opening of
        the  diary.  He  had moved from thoughts to words, and now from
        words to actions. The last step was something that would happen
        in the Ministry of Love.  He  had  accepted  it.  The  end  was
        contained  in  the  beginning. But it was frightening: or, more
        exactly, it was like a foretaste of death, like being a  little
        less  alive.  Even  while  he was speaking to O<span data-line="5911"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5911"></span>Brien, when the
        meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly  shuddering  feeling
        had  taken  possession  of  his  body.  He had the sensation of
        stepping into the dampness of a grave,  and  it  was  not  much
        better because he had always known that the grave was there and
        waiting for him.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="5920"><span data-line="5920"></span>Winston  had  woken  up with his eyes full of tears. Julia
        rolled sleepily against him,  murmuring  something  that  might
        have been <span data-line="5922"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What&#39;s the matter?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5922"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5924"><span data-line="5924"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  dreamt-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5924"></span>  he  began,  and  stopped  short.  It was too
        complex to be put into words. There was the dream  itself,  and
        there  was  a  memory  connected with it that had swum into his
        mind in the few seconds after waking.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5929"><span data-line="5929"></span>He lay back with  his  eyes  shut,  still  sodden  in  the
        atmosphere of the dream. It was a vast, luminous dream in which
        his  whole  life  seemed  to  stretch  out  before  him  like a
        landscape on a summer evening after rain. It had  all  occurred
        inside  the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glass was
        the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was flooded
        with clear soft light in which one could see into  interminable
        distances.  The  dream had also been comprehended by — indeed,
        in some sense it had consisted in — a gesture of the arm  made
        by  his mother, and made again thirty years later by the Jewish
        woman he had seen on the news film, trying to shelter the small
        boy from the bullets, before the helicopter blew them  both  to
        pieces.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5943"><span data-line="5943"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do you know,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5943"></span> he said, <span data-line="5943"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">that until this moment I believed
        I had murdered my mother?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5944"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5946"><span data-line="5946"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Why did you murder her?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5946"></span> said Julia, almost asleep.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5948"><span data-line="5948"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I didn&#39;t murder her. Not physically.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="5948"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5950"><span data-line="5950"></span>In  the  dream  he  had remembered his last glimpse of his
        mother, and within a few moments of waking the cluster of small
        events surrounding it had all come back. It was a  memory  that
        he  must have deliberately pushed out of his consciousness over
        many years. He was not certain of the date, but  he  could  not
        have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it had
        happened.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5958"><span data-line="5958"></span>His  father  had  disappeared  some time earlier, how much
        earlier  he  could  not  remember.  He  remembered  better  the
        rackety,  uneasy  circumstances  of  the  time:  the periodical
        panics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube stations, the
        piles of rubble everywhere,  the  unintelligible  proclamations
        posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the
        same  colour,  the  enormous  queues  outside the bakeries, the
        intermittent machine-gun fire in the distance — above all, the
        fact that there was never enough to  eat.  He  remembered  long
        afternoons  spent  with other boys in scrounging round dustbins
        and rubbish heaps, picking out  the  ribs  of  cabbage  leaves,
        potato peelings, sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from
        which  they  carefully  scraped  away  the cinders; and also in
        waiting for the  passing  of  trucks  which  travelled  over  a
        certain  route  and were known to carry cattle feed, and which,
        when they jolted over the bad patches in  the  road,  sometimes
        spilt a few fragments of oil-cake.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5976"><span data-line="5976"></span>When  his  father disappeared, his mother did not show any
        surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden  change  came  over
        her.  She  seemed  to have become completely spiritless. It was
        evident even to Winston that she was waiting for something that
        she knew must happen. She did everything  that  was  needed  —
        cooked,  washed,  mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dusted
        the mantelpiece — always very slowly and with a  curious  lack
        of  superfluous  motion, like an artist<span data-line="5983"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5983"></span>s lay-figure moving of
        its own accord.  Her  large  shapely  body  seemed  to  relapse
        naturally  into  stillness.  For  hours at a time she would sit
        almost immobile on the bed, nursing his young sister,  a  tiny,
        ailing,  very  silent  child  of two or three, with a face made
        simian by thinness. Very occasionally she would take Winston in
        her arms and press him against her  for  a  long  time  without
        saying anything. He was aware, in spite of his youthfulness and
        selfishness,   that   this   was  somehow  connected  with  the
        never-mentioned thing that was about to happen.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="5994"><span data-line="5994"></span>He  remembered  the  room  where  they  lived,   a   dark,
        closesmelling  room  that  seemed  half  filled by a bed with a
        white counterpane. There was a gas ring in the  fender,  and  a
        shelf where food was kept, and on the landing outside there was
        a   brown   earthenware  sink,  common  to  several  rooms.  He
        remembered his mother<span data-line="5999"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5999"></span>s statuesque body bending  over  the  gas
        ring  to  stir  at  something  in  a  saucepan.  Above  all  he
        remembered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid battles
        at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly, over and  over
        again, why there was not more food, he would shout and storm at
        her  (he  even  remembered  the  tones  of his voice, which was
        beginning to  break  prematurely  and  sometimes  boomed  in  a
        peculiar  way), or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos
        in his efforts to get more than his share. His mother was quite
        ready to give him more than his share. She took it for  granted
        that  he,  <span data-line="6009"></span>&#8216;_the  boy&#8217;<span data-line="6009"></span>,  should  have  the  biggest portion; but
        however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. At every
        meal she would beseech him not to be selfish  and  to  remember
        that  his  little  sister was sick and also needed food, but it
        was no use. He  would  cry  out  with  rage  when  she  stopped
        ladling,  he  would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of
        her hands, he would grab bits from his sister<span data-line="6015"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6015"></span>s plate. He  knew
        that  he  was starving the other two, but he could not help it;
        he even felt that he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger
        in his belly seemed to  justify  him.  Between  meals,  if  his
        mother  did not stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the
        wretched store of food on the shelf.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6022"><span data-line="6022"></span>One day a chocolate-ration was issued. There had  been  no
        such  issue  for  weeks  or  months  past.  He remembered quite
        clearly that precious little morsel  of  chocolate.  It  was  a
        two-ounce  slab  (they still talked about ounces in those days)
        between the three of them. It was obvious that it ought  to  be
        divided  into  three  equal  parts. Suddenly, as though he were
        listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself demanding  in
        a  loud  booming voice that he should be given the whole piece.
        His mother told him not to be greedy. There was a long, nagging
        argument that went round and round, with shouts, whines, tears,
        remonstrances, bargainings. His tiny sister,  clinging  to  her
        mother with both hands, exactly like a baby monkey, sat looking
        over  her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. In the end
        his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate  and  gave
        it  to  Winston,  giving  the  other quarter to his sister. The
        little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not
        knowing what it was. Winston stood watching her for  a  moment.
        Then  with  a  sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of
        chocolate out of his sister<span data-line="6040"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6040"></span>s hand  and  was  fleeing  for  the
        door.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6043"><span data-line="6043"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Winston,  Winston!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6043"></span>  his  mother  called after him. <span data-line="6043"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Come
        back! Give your sister back her chocolate!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6044"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6046"><span data-line="6046"></span>He stopped, but did not come back.  His  mother<span data-line="6046"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6046"></span>s  anxious
        eyes were fixed on his face. Even now he was thinking about the
        thing,  he  did  not  know what it was that was on the point of
        happening. His sister,  conscious  of  having  been  robbed  of
        something,  had  set  up a feeble wail. His mother drew her arm
        round the child  and  pressed  its  face  against  her  breast.
        Something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying. He
        turned  and  fled  down  the stairs. with the chocolate growing
        sticky in his hand.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6056"><span data-line="6056"></span>He never saw his mother again. After he had  devoured  the
        chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in
        the  streets  for  several  hours, until hunger drove him home.
        When he came back his mother had disappeared. This was  already
        becoming  normal  at  that time. Nothing was gone from the room
        except his mother and  his  sister.  They  had  not  taken  any
        clothes, not even his mother<span data-line="6062"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6062"></span>s overcoat. To this day he did not
        know  with  any  certainty  that  his  mother  was dead. It was
        perfectly  possible  that  she  had  merely  been  sent  to   a
        forced-labour  camp.  As  for  his  sister, she might have been
        removed, like Winston himself,  to  one  of  the  colonies  for
        homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called) which
        had  grown  up  as a result of the civil war, or she might have
        been sent to the labour camp along with his mother,  or  simply
        left somewhere or other to die.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6072"><span data-line="6072"></span>The  dream  was  still  vivid  in his mind, especially the
        enveloping protecting gesture of the arm  in  which  its  whole
        meaning  seemed  to be contained. His mind went back to another
        dream of two months ago. Exactly as his mother had sat  on  the
        dingy  whitequilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so she
        had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath  him,  and  drowning
        deeper  every  minute,  but still looking up at him through the
        darkening water.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6081"><span data-line="6081"></span>He told Julia the story  of  his  mother<span data-line="6081"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6081"></span>s  disappearance.
        Without  opening  her  eyes she rolled over and settled herself
        into a more comfortable position.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6085"><span data-line="6085"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I expect you were a beastly little swine in those  days,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6085"></span>
        she said indistinctly. <span data-line="6086"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">All children are swine.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6086"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6088"><span data-line="6088"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes. But the real point of the story-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6088"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6090"><span data-line="6090"></span>From  her  breathing it was evident that she was going off
        to sleep again. He would have liked to continue  talking  about
        his  mother. He did not suppose, from what he could remember of
        her, that  she  had  been  an  unusual  woman,  still  less  an
        intelligent  one; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility,
        a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she  obeyed
        were  private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not be
        altered from outside. It would not have occurred to her that an
        action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you
        loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else  to
        give,  you  still gave him love. When the last of the chocolate
        was gone, his mother had clasped the child in her arms. It  was
        no  use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more chocolate,
        it did not avert the child<span data-line="6103"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6103"></span>s death or her own;  but  it  seemed
        natural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also
        covered  the  little  boy  with  her arm, which was no more use
        against the bullets than a sheet of paper. The  terrible  thing
        that the Party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses,
        mere  feelings,  were  of  no  account,  while at the same time
        robbing you of all power over the material world. When once you
        were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did  not  feel,
        what  you  did  or  refrained  from  doing,  made  literally no
        difference. Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor
        your actions were ever heard of again. You  were  lifted  clean
        out of the stream of history. And yet to the people of only two
        generations  ago  this  would  not  have  seemed all-important,
        because they were not attempting to alter  history.  They  were
        governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What
        mattered   were  individual  relationships,  and  a  completely
        helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a  dying
        man,  could  have  value  in  itself.  The  proles, it suddenly
        occurred to him, had remained in this condition. They were  not
        loyal  to  a  party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to
        one another. For the first time in his life he did not  despise
        the  proles  or  think  of  them merely as an inert force which
        would one day spring to life  and  regenerate  the  world.  The
        proles  had  stayed human. They had not become hardened inside.
        They had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had
        to re-learn by  conscious  effort.  And  in  thinking  this  he
        remembered,  without apparent relevance, how a few weeks ago he
        had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it
        into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6133"><span data-line="6133"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The proles are human beings,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6133"></span> he said aloud. <span data-line="6133"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We are  not
        human.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6134"></span>

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6138"><span data-line="6138"></span>He  thought  for  a little while. <span data-line="6138"></span>&#8216;_Has it ever occurred to

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6143"><span data-line="6143"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,  dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I&#39;m
        not going to do it, all the same.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6144"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6146"><span data-line="6146"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We&#39;ve been lucky,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6146"></span>  he  said  <span data-line="6146"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">but  it  can&#39;t  last  much
        longer. You&#39;re young. You look normal and innocent. If you keep
        clear of people like me, you might stay alive for another fifty
        years.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6149"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6151"><span data-line="6151"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No.  I&#39;ve  thought  it all out. What you do, I&#39;m going to
        do. And don&#39;t be too downhearted. I&#39;m rather  good  at  staying
        alive.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6153"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6155"><span data-line="6155"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We  may  be  together for another six months — a year —
        there&#39;s no knowing. At the end we&#39;re certain to  be  apart.  Do
        you  realize  how utterly alone we shall be? When once they get
        hold of us there  will  be  nothing,  literally  nothing,  that
        either  of us can do for the other. If I confess, they&#39;ll shoot
        you, and if I refuse to confess, they&#39;ll  shoot  you  just  the
        same. Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from saying,
        will put off your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of
        us  will even know whether the other is alive or dead. We shall
        be utterly without power  of  any  kind.  The  one  thing  that
        matters  is that we shouldn&#39;t betray one another, although even
        that can&#39;t make the slightest difference.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6166"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6168"><span data-line="6168"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">If you mean confessing,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6168"></span> she said,  <span data-line="6168"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">we  shall  do  that,
        right  enough.  Everybody  always confesses. You can&#39;t help it.
        They torture you.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6170"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6172"><span data-line="6172"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I don&#39;t mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What
        you say or do doesn&#39;t matter: only  feelings  matter.  If  they
        could  make  me  stop  loving  you  —  that  would be the real
        betrayal.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6175"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6177"><span data-line="6177"></span>She thought it  over.  <span data-line="6177"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They  can&#39;t  do  that,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6177"></span>  she  said
        finally.  <span data-line="6178"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s  the one thing they can&#39;t do. They can make you
        say anything — anything — but they can&#39;t make you believe it. 
        They can&#39;t get inside you.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6180"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6182"><span data-line="6182"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6182"></span> he said a little more hopefully, <span data-line="6182"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">no;  that&#39;s  quite
        true.  They  can&#39;t  get inside you. If you can feel that
        staying human is worth while,  even  when  it  can&#39;t  have  any
        result whatever, you&#39;ve beaten them.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6185"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6187"><span data-line="6187"></span>He  thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear.
        They could spy upon you night and day, but  if  you  kept  your
        head  you  could  still  outwit them. With all their cleverness
        they had never mastered the secret of finding out what  another
        human  being  was thinking. Perhaps that was less true when you
        were actually in their hands. One did not  know  what  happened
        inside  the  Ministry  of  Love,  but it was possible to guess:
        tortures, drugs,  delicate  instruments  that  registered  your
        nervous  reactions,  gradual  wearing-down by sleeplessness and
        solitude and persistent questioning. Facts, at any rate,  could
        not be kept hidden. They could be tracked down by enquiry, they
        could  be squeezed out of you by torture. But if the object was
        not to stay alive but to stay human,  what  difference  did  it
        ultimately  make?  They could not alter your feelings: for that
        matter you could not alter them yourself, even  if  you  wanted
        to.  They  could  lay bare in the utmost detail everything that
        you had done or said or thought; but  the  inner  heart,  whose
        workings   were   mysterious   even   to   yourself,   remained
        impregnable.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="6209"><span data-line="6209"></span>They had done it, they had done it at last!
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6211"><span data-line="6211"></span>The room they were standing in was long-shaped and  softly
        lit. The telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness of
        the  dark-blue  carpet  gave  one the impression of treading on
        velvet. At the far end of the room O<span data-line="6214"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6214"></span>Brien  was  sitting  at  a
        table  under  a  green-shaded  lamp,  with  a mass of papers on
        either side of him. He had not bothered to  look  up  when  the
        servant showed Julia and Winston in.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6219"><span data-line="6219"></span>Winston<span data-line="6219"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6219"></span>s  heart  was  thumping  so  hard  that he doubted
        whether he would be able to speak. They had done it,  they  had
        done it at last, was all he could think. It had been a rash act
        to come here at all, and sheer folly to arrive together; though
        it was true that they had come by different routes and only met
        on  O<span data-line="6224"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6224"></span>Brien<span data-line="6224"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6224"></span>s  doorstep.  But  merely to walk into such a place
        needed an effort of  the  nerve.  It  was  only  on  very  rare
        occasions  that one saw inside the dwelling-places of the Inner
        Party, or even penetrated into the quarter of  the  town  where
        they  lived.  The  whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats,
        the richness and spaciousness  of  everything,  the  unfamiliar
        smells of good food and good tobacco, the silent and incredibly
        rapid  lifts  sliding  up and down, the white-jacketed servants
        hurrying to and fro — everything was intimidating. Although he
        had a good pretext for coming here, he  was  haunted  at  every
        step  by  the  fear that a black-uniformed guard would suddenly
        appear from round the corner, demand his papers, and order  him
        to get out. O<span data-line="6236"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6236"></span>Brien<span data-line="6236"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6236"></span>s servant, however, had admitted the two of
        them  without demur. He was a small, dark-haired man in a white
        jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely  expressionless  face
        which might have been that of a Chinese. The passage down which
        he  led  them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and
        white  wainscoting,  all  exquisitely  clean.  That   too   was
        intimidating.  Winston  could  not remember ever to have seen a
        passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human
        bodies.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6246"><span data-line="6246"></span>O<span data-line="6246"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6246"></span>Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed
        to be studying it intently. His heavy face, bent down  so  that
        one  could see the line of the nose, looked both formidable and
        intelligent.  For  perhaps  twenty  seconds  he   sat   without
        stirring.  Then he pulled the speakwrite towards him and rapped
        out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6253"><span data-line="6253"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Items one comma five comma seven approved  fullwise  stop
        suggestion  contained  item  six  doubleplus ridiculous verging
        crimethink cancel stop unproceed  constructionwise  antegetting
        plusfull estimates machinery overheads stop end message.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6256"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6258"><span data-line="6258"></span>He  rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them
        across  the  soundless  carpet.  A  little  of   the   official
        atmosphere  seemed  to  have  fallen  away  from  him  with the
        Newspeak words, but his expression was grimmer than  usual,  as
        though  he were not pleased at being disturbed. The terror that
        Winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a  streak  of
        ordinary embarrassment. It seemed to him quite possible that he
        had  simply  made a stupid mistake. For what evidence had he in
        reality that O<span data-line="6266"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6266"></span>Brien was any  kind  of  political  conspirator?
        Nothing  but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark:
        beyond that, only his  own  secret  imaginings,  founded  on  a
        dream.  He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had
        come to borrow the dictionary, because  in  that  case  Julia<span data-line="6270"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6270"></span>s
        presence  was  impossible  to  explain.  As  O<span data-line="6271"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6271"></span>Brien passed the
        telescreen a thought seemed to strike him. He  stopped,  turned
        aside and pressed a switch on the wall. There was a sharp snap.
        The voice had stopped.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6276"><span data-line="6276"></span>Julia  uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise.
        Even in the midst of his panic,  Winston  was  too  much  taken
        aback to be able to hold his tongue.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6280"><span data-line="6280"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You can turn it off!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6280"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6282"><span data-line="6282"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6282"></span>  said  O<span data-line="6282"></span>&#8216;Brien,  &#8217;<span data-line="6282"></span><em class="em-low1">we  can turn it off. We have that
        privilege.</em><span data-line="6283"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6283"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6285"><span data-line="6285"></span>He was opposite them now. His solid form towered over  the
        pair  of  them,  and  the  expression  on  his  face  was still
        indecipherable. He was waiting, somewhat sternly,  for  Winston
        to  speak,  but  about  what? Even now it was quite conceivable
        that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably  why  he  had
        been  interrupted.  Nobody  spoke.  After  the  stopping of the
        telescreen the room seemed deadly silent. The  seconds  marched
        past,  enormous.  With difficulty Winston continued to keep his
        eyes fixed on O<span data-line="6293"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6293"></span>Brien<span data-line="6293"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6293"></span>s. Then suddenly the grim face broke down
        into what might have been the beginnings of a smile.  With  his
        characteristic  gesture O<span data-line="6295"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6295"></span>Brien resettled his spectacles on his
        nose.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6298"><span data-line="6298"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Shall I say it, or will you?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6298"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6300"><span data-line="6300"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I will say it,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6300"></span> said Winston  promptly.  <span data-line="6300"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That  thing  is
        really turned off?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6301"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6303"><span data-line="6303"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6303"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6305"><span data-line="6305"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We have come here because-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6305"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6307"><span data-line="6307"></span>He  paused,  realizing for the first time the vagueness of
        his own motives. Since he did not in fact  know  what  kind  of
        help  he  expected  from O<span data-line="6309"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6309"></span>Brien, it was not easy to say why he
        had come here. He went on, conscious that what  he  was  saying
        must sound both feeble and pretentious:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6313"><span data-line="6313"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We  believe  that  there is some kind of conspiracy, some
        kind of secret organization working against the Party, and that
        you are involved in it. We want to join it and work for it.  We
        are  enemies  of  the Party. We disbelieve in the principles of
        Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We  are  also  adulterers.  I
        tell  you  this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy.
        If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any  other  way,  we
        are ready.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6320"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6322"><span data-line="6322"></span>He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling
        that the  door had opened. Sure enough, the little yellow-faced
        servant had come in without knocking. Winston saw that  he  was
        carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6327"><span data-line="6327"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Martin  is  one  of us,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6327"></span> said O<span data-line="6327"></span>&#8216;Brien impassively. &#8217;<span data-line="6327"></span><em class="em-low1">Bring
        the drinks over here, Martin. Put them on the round table. Have
        we enough chairs? Then we may as well  sit  down  and  talk  in
        comfort.  Bring a chair for yourself, Martin. This is business.
        You can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes.</em><span data-line="6331"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6331"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6333"><span data-line="6333"></span>The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet  still
        with  a  servant-like  air,  the  air  of  a  valet  enjoying a
        privilege. Winston regarded him out of the corner of  his  eye.
        It struck him that the man<span data-line="6336"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6336"></span>s whole life was playing a part, and
        that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality
        even  for  a  moment. O<span data-line="6338"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6338"></span>Brien took the decanter by the neck and
        filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid.  It  aroused  in
        Winston  dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a
        hoarding — a vast bottle composed  of  electric  lights  which
        seemed  to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass.
        Seen from the top the stuff looked almost  black,  but  in  the
        decanter  it gleamed like a ruby. It had a sour-sweet smell. He
        saw Julia pick  up  her  glass  and  sniff  at  it  with  frank
        curiosity.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6348"><span data-line="6348"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It is called wine,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6348"></span> said O<span data-line="6348"></span>&#8216;Brien with a faint smile. &#8217;<span data-line="6348"></span><em class="em-low1">You
        will have read about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it gets
        to the  Outer  Party, I am afraid.</em><span data-line="6350"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6350"></span> His face grew solemn again,
        and he raised his glass: <span data-line="6351"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I think it is fitting that we  should
        begin  by  drinking  a  health.  To  our  Leader:  To  Emmanuel
        Goldstein.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6353"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6355"><span data-line="6355"></span>Winston took up his glass with a certain  eagerness.  Wine
        was  a  thing  he  had  read  and dreamed about. Like the glass
        paperweight or  Mr  Charrington<span data-line="6357"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6357"></span>s  half-remembered  rhymes,  it
        belonged  to  the vanished, romantic past, the olden time as he
        liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason he had
        always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like
        that of blackberry jam and an  immediate  intoxicating  effect.
        Actually,  when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly
        disappointing. The truth was that after years  of  gin-drinking
        he could barely taste it. He set down the empty glass.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6366"><span data-line="6366"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Then there is such a person as Goldstein?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6366"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6368"><span data-line="6368"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where, I do
        not know.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6369"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6371"><span data-line="6371"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And the conspiracy — the organization? Is it real? It is
        not simply an invention of the Thought Police?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6372"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6374"><span data-line="6374"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No,  it  is  real.  The Brotherhood, we call it. You will
        never learn much more about the Brotherhood than that it exists
        and that you belong to it. I will come back to that presently.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6376"></span>
        He looked at his wrist-watch. <span data-line="6377"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It is unwise even for members of
        the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for more  than  half
        an hour. You ought not to have come here together, and you will
        have to leave separately. You, comrade</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6380"></span> — he bowed his head to
        Julia — <span data-line="6381"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">will leave first. We have about twenty minutes at our
        disposal.  You  will understand that I must start by asking you
        certain questions. In general terms, what are you  prepared  to
        do?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6384"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6386"><span data-line="6386"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Anything that we are capable of,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6386"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6388"><span data-line="6388"></span>O<span data-line="6388"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6388"></span>Brien  had  turned himself a little in his chair so that
        he was facing Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take
        it for granted that Winston could speak for her. For  a  moment
        the  lids  flitted  down  over  his  eyes.  He began asking his
        questions in a low, expressionless voice, as though this were a
        routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers were  known

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6442"><span data-line="6442"></span>It  appeared  to Winston that a long time passed before he
        answered. For a moment he seemed even to have been deprived  of
        the power of speech. His tongue worked soundlessly, forming the
        opening  syllables  first  of one word, then of the other, over
        and over again. Until he had said it, he  did  not  know  which
        word he was going to say. <span data-line="6447"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6447"></span> he said finally.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6449"><span data-line="6449"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  did well to tell me,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6449"></span> said O<span data-line="6449"></span>&#8216;Brien. &#8217;<span data-line="6449"></span><em class="em-low1">It is necessary
        for us to know everything.</em><span data-line="6450"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6450"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6452"><span data-line="6452"></span>He turned himself toward Julia and added in a  voice  with
        somewhat more expression in it:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6455"><span data-line="6455"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do  you understand that even if he survives, it may be as
        a different person? We  may  be  obliged  to  give  him  a  new
        identity.  His face, his movements, the shape of his hands, the
        colour of his hair — even his voice would  be  different.  And
        you yourself might have become a different person. Our surgeons
        can alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes it is necessary.
        Sometimes we even amputate a limb.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6461"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6463"><span data-line="6463"></span>Winston  could  not help snatching another sidelong glance
        at Martin<span data-line="6464"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6464"></span>s Mongolian face. There were no scars that  he  could
        see.  Julia had turned a shade paler, so that her freckles were
        showing, but she faced O<span data-line="6466"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6466"></span>Brien boldly. She  murmured  something
        that seemed to be assent.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6469"><span data-line="6469"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Good. Then that is settled.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6469"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6471"><span data-line="6471"></span>There  was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a
        rather  absent-minded  air  O<span data-line="6472"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6472"></span>Brien  pushed  them  towards  the
        others,  took  one  himself,  then  stood  up and began to pace
        slowly to and fro, as though he could  think  better  standing.
        They  were  very  good  cigarettes, very thick and well-packed,
        with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper.  O<span data-line="6476"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6476"></span>Brien  looked  at
        his wrist-watch again.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6479"><span data-line="6479"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6479"></span> he said.
        <span data-line="6480"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I shall switch on in a quarter of an hour. Take a good look at
        these comrades</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6481"></span> faces before you go. You will  be  seeing  them
        again. I may not.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6484"><span data-line="6484"></span>Exactly  as  they  had  done at the front door, the little
        man<span data-line="6485"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6485"></span>s dark eyes flickered over their faces.  There  was  not  a
        trace  of  friendliness  in his manner. He was memorizing their
        appearance, but he felt no interest in  them,  or  appeared  to
        feel  none.  It  occurred  to Winston that a synthetic face was
        perhaps incapable of changing its expression. Without  speaking
        or  giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, closing the
        door silently behind him. O<span data-line="6491"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6491"></span>Brien was strolling  up  and  down,
        one hand in the pocket of his black overalls, the other holding
        his cigarette.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6495"><span data-line="6495"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  understand,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6495"></span>  he said, <span data-line="6495"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">that you will be fighting in
        the dark. You will always be in  the  dark.  You  will  receive
        orders  and  you  will  obey them, without knowing why. Later I
        shall send you a book from which you will learn the true nature
        of the society we live in, and the strategy by which  we  shall
        destroy  it.  When  you  have  read  the book, you will be full
        members of the Brotherhood. But between the general  aims  that
        we are fighting for and the immediate tasks of the moment, you
        will  never  know  anything.  I  tell  you that the Brotherhood
        exists, but I cannot tell you  whether  it  numbers  a  hundred
        members,  or ten million. From your personal knowledge you will
        never be able to say that it numbers even as many as  a  dozen.
        You  will have three or four contacts, who will be renewed from
        time to time as they disappear. As this was your first contact,
        it will be preserved. When you receive orders, they  will  come
        from  me.  If  we find it necessary to communicate with you, it
        will be through Martin. When you are finally caught,  you  will
        confess.  That is unavoidable. But you will have very little to
        confess, other than your own actions. You will not be  able  to
        betray  more than a handful of unimportant people. Probably you
        will not even betray me. By that time I may be dead, or I shall
        have become a different person, with a different face.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6516"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6518"><span data-line="6518"></span>He continued to move to and fro over the soft  carpet.  In
        spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace
        in his movements. It came out even in the gesture with which he
        thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipulated a cigarette. More
        even  than of strength, he gave an impression of confidence and
        of an understanding tinged by irony. However much in earnest he
        might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that  belongs
        to  a  fanatic.  When  he  spoke  of  murder, suicide, venereal
        disease, amputated limbs, and altered  faces,  it  was  with  a
        faint  air  of  persiflage.  <span data-line="6527"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">This  is  unavoidable,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6527"></span> his voice
        seemed to say; <span data-line="6528"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">this is what we have got to do,  unflinchingly.
        But  this  is  not  what  we  shall be doing when life is worth
        living again.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6530"></span> A wave of admiration, almost of worship,  flowed
        out  from  Winston  towards  O<span data-line="6531"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6531"></span>Brien.  For  the  moment  he had
        forgotten the shadowy figure of Goldstein. When you  looked  at
        O<span data-line="6533"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6533"></span>Brien<span data-line="6533"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6533"></span>s  powerful  shoulders  and his blunt-featured face, so
        ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible to believe that he
        could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he was not equal
        to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia  seemed  to
        be  impressed.  She  had  let  her  cigarette  go  out  and was
        listening intently. O<span data-line="6538"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6538"></span>Brien went on:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6540"><span data-line="6540"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You will have heard  rumours  of  the  existence  of  the
        Brotherhood.  No  doubt you have formed your own picture of it.
        You have imagined, probably, a huge underworld of conspirators,
        meeting secretly in  cellars,  scribbling  messages  on  walls,
        recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of
        the  hand.  Nothing  of  the  kind  exists.  The members of the
        Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and  it  is
        impossible  for  any  one member to be aware of the identity of
        more than a few others. Goldstein himself, if he fell into  the
        hands  of  the  Thought  Police, could not give them a complete
        list of members, or any information that would lead them  to  a
        complete  list.  No such list exists. The Brotherhood cannot be
        wiped out because it is not an  organization  in  the  ordinary
        sense.  Nothing  holds  it  together  except  an  idea which is
        indestructible. You will never have anything  to  sustain  you,
        except   the   idea.   You  will  get  no  comradeship  and  no
        encouragement. When finally you are caught,  you  will  get  no
        help. We never help our members. At most, when it is absolutely
        necessary  that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally
        able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner&#39;s cell. You  will
        have  to  get  used to living without results and without hope.
        You will work for  a  while,  you  will  be  caught,  you  will
        confess, and then you will die. Those are the only results that
        you will ever see. There is no possibility that any perceptible
        change  will  happen  within our own lifetime. We are the dead.
        Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part  in  it
        as  handfuls  of  dust  and splinters of bone. But how far away
        that future may be, there is no knowing. It might be a thousand
        years. At present nothing is possible except to extend the area
        of sanity little by little. We cannot act collectively. We  can
        only   spread   our   knowledge  outwards  from  individual  to
        individual, generation after generation. In  the  face  of  the
        Thought Police there is no other way.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6572"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6574"><span data-line="6574"></span>He  halted  and  looked  for  the third time at his 
        wrist-watch.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6577"><span data-line="6577"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It is almost time for you to leave, comrade,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6577"></span> he said  to
        Julia. <span data-line="6578"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Wait. The decanter is still half full.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6578"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6580"><span data-line="6580"></span>He  filled  the  glasses  and  raised his own glass by the
        stem.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6583"><span data-line="6583"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What shall it be this time?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6583"></span> he said, still with the same
        faint suggestion of irony. <span data-line="6584"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">To the  confusion  of  the  Thought
        Police?  To  the  death  of  Big  Brother?  To humanity? To the
        future?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6586"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6588"><span data-line="6588"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">To the past,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6588"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6590"><span data-line="6590"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The past is more important,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6590"></span> agreed O<span data-line="6590"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6590"></span>Brien gravely.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6592"><span data-line="6592"></span>They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood
        up to go. O<span data-line="6593"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6593"></span>Brien took a small box from the top  of  a  cabinet
        and  handed  her a flat white tablet which he told her to place
        on her tongue. It  was  important,  he  said,  not  to  go  out
        smelling  of  wine: the lift attendants were very observant. As
        soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget  her
        existence.  He  took  another  pace  or  two  up and down, then
        stopped.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6601"><span data-line="6601"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There are details to be settled,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6601"></span> he said. <span data-line="6601"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I assume that
        you have a hiding-place of some kind?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6602"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6604"><span data-line="6604"></span>Winston explained about the  room  over  Mr  Charrington<span data-line="6604"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6604"></span>s
        shop.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6607"><span data-line="6607"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That  will  do  for  the  moment.  Later  we will arrange
        something else  for  you.  It  is  important  to  change  one&#39;s
        hiding-place  frequently.  Meanwhile I shall send you a copy of
        the book</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6610"></span> — even O<span data-line="6610"></span>&#8216;Brien, Winston  noticed,  seemed  to
        pronounce   the   words   as   though  they  were  in  italics-
        &#8217;<span data-line="6612"></span><em class="em-low1">Goldstein&#39;s book, you understand, as soon as possible. It  may
        be  some  days before I can get hold of one. There are not many
        in existence, as you can imagine. The Thought Police hunt  them
        down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them. It
        makes  very  little  difference. The book is indestructible. If
        the last copy were gone, we could reproduce it almost word  for
        word. Do you carry a brief-case to work with you?</em><span data-line="6618"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6618"></span> he added.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6620"><span data-line="6620"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">As a rule, yes.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6620"></span>

<p class="p indent" data-line="6622"><span data-line="6622"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What is it like?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6622"></span>

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6626"><span data-line="6626"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Black,  two  straps,  very shabby — good. One day in the

        among  your  morning&#39;s work will contain a misprinted word, and
        you will have to ask for a repeat. On  the  following  day  you
        will  go  to  work without your brief-case. At some time during
        the day, in the street, a man will touch you on the arm and say
        &#8220;I think you have dropped your brief-case.&#8221; The  one  he  gives
        you will contain a copy of Goldstein&#39;s book. You will return it
        within fourteen days.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6634"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6636"><span data-line="6636"></span>They were silent for a moment.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6638"><span data-line="6638"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There  are  a couple of minutes before you need go,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6638"></span> said

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6641"><span data-line="6641"></span>Winston looked up at him. <span data-line="6641"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">In the place where there is  no
        darkness?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6642"></span> he said hesitantly.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6644"><span data-line="6644"></span>O<span data-line="6644"></span>&#8216;Brien  nodded  without  appearance  of surprise. &#8217;<span data-line="6644"></span><em class="em-low1">In the

        anything that you wish to say before you  leave?  Any  message?
        Any question?.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6648"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6650"><span data-line="6650"></span>Winston  thought.  There  did  not  seem to be any further
        question that he wanted to ask: still  less  did  he  feel  any
        impulse   to   utter  high-sounding  generalities.  Instead  of
        anything directly connected with O<span data-line="6653"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6653"></span>Brien  or  the  Brotherhood,
        there  came  into  his  mind a sort of composite picture of the
        dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and  the
        little   room   over  Mr  Charrington<span data-line="6656"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6656"></span>s  shop,  and  the  glass
        paperweight, and the steel engraving  in  its  rosewood  frame.
        Almost at random he said:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6660"><span data-line="6660"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Did  you  ever  happen  to  hear an old rhyme that begins
        &#8220;Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement&#39;s&#8221;?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6661"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6663"><span data-line="6663"></span>Again O<span data-line="6663"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6663"></span>Brien nodded. With a sort  of  grave  courtesy  he
        completed the stanza:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="6666" style="display:block"><code>         &#39;_Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement&#39;s,
         You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin&#39;s,
         When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey
         When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch._&#39;</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="6671"><span data-line="6671"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You knew the last line!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6671"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6673"><span data-line="6673"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,  I  knew  the last line. And now, I am afraid, it is
        time for you to go. But wait. You had better let  me  give  you
        one of these tablets.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6675"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6677"><span data-line="6677"></span>As  Winston stood up O<span data-line="6677"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6677"></span>Brien held out a hand. His powerful
        grip crushed the bones of Winston<span data-line="6678"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6678"></span>s palm. At the  door  Winston
        looked  back,  but  O<span data-line="6679"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6679"></span>Brien  seemed already to be in process of
        putting him out of mind. He was waiting with his  hand  on  the
        switch that controlled the telescreen. Beyond him Winston could
        see  the  writing-table  with  its  green-  shaded lamp and the
        speakwrite and the wire baskets deep- laden  with  papers.  The
        incident was closed. Within thirty seconds, it occurred to him,
        O<span data-line="6685"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6685"></span>Brien  would be back at his interrupted and important work on
        behalf of the Party.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="6690"><span data-line="6690"></span>Winston was gelatinous with fatigue.  Gelatinous  was  the
        right  word.  It had come into his head spontaneously. His body
        seemed to have not only  the  weakness  of  a  jelly,  but  its
        translucency.  He  felt that if he held up his hand he would be
        able to see the light through it. All the blood and  lymph  had
        been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving
        only  a  frail  structure  of  nerves,  bones,  and  skin.  All
        sensations seemed to be magnified.  His  overalls  fretted  his
        shoulders,  the pavement tickled his feet, even the opening and
        closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6701"><span data-line="6701"></span>He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So  had
        everyone  else in the Ministry. Now it was all over, and he had
        literally nothing to do, no  Party  work  of  any  description,
        until  tomorrow  morning.  He  could  spend  six  hours  in the
        hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly,  in  mild
        afternoon  sunshine,  he  walked  up  a  dingy  street  in  the
        direction of Mr Charrington<span data-line="6707"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6707"></span>s shop, keeping one  eye  open  for
        the  patrols,  but  irrationally  convinced that this afternoon
        there was no danger of anyone interfering with him.  The  heavy
        brief-case that he was carrying bumped against his knee at each
        step,  sending a tingling sensation up and down the skin of his
        leg. Inside it was the book, which he had now had in his
        possession for six days and had not yet opened, nor even looked
        at.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6716"><span data-line="6716"></span>On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions,  the
        speeches,  the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters,
        the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing  of
        trumpets,  the  tramp  of  marching  feet,  the grinding of the
        caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes,  the  booming
        of  guns  —  after six days of this, when the great orgasm was
        quivering to its climax and the general hatred of  Eurasia  had
        boiled  up  into such delirium that if the crowd could have got
        their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to  be
        publicly  hanged on the last day of the proceedings, they would
        unquestionably have torn them to pieces — at just this  moment
        it  had  been  announced  that Oceania was not after all at war
        with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Eurasia was  an
        ally.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6731"><span data-line="6731"></span>There  was,  of  course,  no admission that any change had
        taken place. Merely it became known,  with  extreme  suddenness
        and  everywhere  at once, that Eastasia and not Eurasia was the
        enemy. Winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the
        central London squares at the moment when it happened.  It  was
        night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly
        floodlit.  The  square was packed with several thousand people,
        including a block of about a  thousand  schoolchildren  in  the
        uniform of the Spies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of
        the  Inner Party, a small lean man with disproportionately long
        arms and a large  bald  skull  over  which  a  few  lank  locks
        straggled,  was  haranguing the crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskin
        figure, contorted with hatred,  he  gripped  the  neck  of  the
        microphone  with  one hand while the other, enormous at the end
        of a bony arm, clawed the air menacingly above  his  head.  His
        voice, made metallic by the amplifiers, boomed forth an endless
        catalogue  of  atrocities,  massacres,  deportations, lootings,
        rapings, torture of  prisoners,  bombing  of  civilians,  lying
        propaganda,  unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It was almost
        impossible to listen to him without being first  convinced  and
        then  maddened.  At  every  few  moments  the fury of the crowd
        boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a  wild
        beast-like  roaring  that rose uncontrollably from thousands of
        throats.  The  most  savage  yells  of  all   came   from   the
        schoolchildren.  The  speech  had  been  proceeding for perhaps
        twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform  and
        a  scrap  of  paper  was  slipped  into  the speaker<span data-line="6757"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6757"></span>s hand. He
        unrolled and read it without pausing  in  his  speech.  Nothing
        altered  in  his  voice or manner, or in the content of what he
        was saying, but suddenly  the  names  were  different.  Without
        words  said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd.
        Oceania was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there  was  a
        tremendous  commotion.  The  banners and posters with which the
        square was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them had the
        wrong faces on them. It was sabotage! The agents  of  Goldstein
        had  been  at work! There was a riotous interlude while posters
        were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds and trampled
        underfoot.  The  Spies  performed  prodigies  of  activity   in
        clambering  over  the  rooftops  and cutting the streamers that
        fluttered from the chimneys. But within two or three minutes it
        was all over. The  orator,  still  gripping  the  neck  of  the
        microphone,  his  shoulders  hunched  forward,  his  free  hand
        clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his  speech.  One
        minute  more,  and  the feral roars of rage were again bursting
        from the crowd. The Hate continued exactly  as  before,  except
        that the target had been changed.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6778"><span data-line="6778"></span>The  thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that
        the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in
        midsentence,  not  only  without  a  pause,  but  without  even
        breaking  the  syntax. But at the moment he had other things to
        preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder  while  the
        posters  were  being torn down that a man whose face he did not
        see had tapped him on the shoulder  and  said,  <span data-line="6784"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Excuse  me,  I
        think  you&#39;ve  dropped your brief-case.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="6785"></span> He took the brief-case
        abstractedly, without speaking. He knew that it would  be  days
        before  he  had  an  opportunity to look inside it. The instant
        that the  demonstration  was  over  he  went  straight  to  the
        Ministry  of Truth, though the time was now nearly twenty-three
        hours. The entire staff of the Ministry had done likewise.  The
        orders  already  issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to
        their posts, were hardly necessary.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6794"><span data-line="6794"></span>Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always  been
        at  war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature
        of five years was now completely obsolete. Reports and  records
        of    all   kinds,   newspapers,   books,   pamphlets,   films,
        sound-tracks,  photographs  —  all  had  to  be  rectified  at
        lightning  speed. Although no directive was ever issued, it was
        known that the chiefs of the Department  intended  that  within
        one  week no reference to the war with Eurasia, or the alliance
        with Eastasia, should remain in existence  anywhere.  The  work
        was overwhelming, all the more so because the processes that it
        involved  could  not be called by their true names. Everyone in
        the  Records  Department   worked   eighteen   hours   in   the
        twenty-four,  with two three-hour snatches of sleep. Mattresses
        were brought up from the  cellars  and  pitched  all  over  the
        corridors:  meals  consisted  of  sandwiches and Victory Coffee
        wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the canteen.  Each
        time  that  Winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he
        tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each  time  that  he
        crawled  back  sticky-eyed  and  aching,  it  was  to find that
        another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk  like  a
        snowdrift, halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the
        floor,  so  that  the first job was always to stack them into a
        neat enough pile to give him room to work. What  was  worst  of
        all  was that the work was by no means purely mechanical. Often
        it was enough merely to substitute one name  for  another,  but
        any  detailed  report  of events demanded care and imagination.
        Even the geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring
        the war from one part of the world to another was considerable.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6823"><span data-line="6823"></span>By the  third  day  his  eyes  ached  unbearably  and  his
        spectacles  needed  wiping  every  few  minutes.  It  was  like
        struggling with some crushing physical  task,  something  which
        one  had  the  right  to  refuse and which one was nevertheless
        neurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as he had time to
        remember it, he was not troubled by the fact that every word he
        murmured into the speakwrite, every stroke of  his  ink-pencil,
        was  a  deliberate lie. He was as anxious as anyone else in the
        Department that the forgery should be perfect. On  the  morning
        of  the  sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down. For as
        much as half an hour nothing came out of  the  tube;  then  one
        more  cylinder, then nothing. Everywhere at about the same time
        the work was easing off. A deep and as it were secret sigh went
        through the Department. A mighty deed,  which  could  never  be
        mentioned,  had  been  achieved.  It was now impossible for any
        human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war  with
        Eurasia   had   ever   happened.   At  twelve  hundred  it  was
        unexpectedly announced that all workers in  the  Ministry  were
        free   till  tomorrow  morning.  Winston,  still  carrying  the
        brief-case  containing  the  book,  which  had  remained
        between  his  feet  while he worked and under his body while he
        slept, went home, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in his
        bath, although the water was barely more than tepid.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6847"><span data-line="6847"></span>With a sort  of  voluptuous  creaking  in  his  joints  he
        climbed  the  stair  above Mr Charrington<span data-line="6848"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6848"></span>s shop. He was tired,
        but not sleepy any longer. He opened the window, lit the  dirty
        little  oilstove  and  put  on a pan of water for coffee. Julia
        would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book. He
        sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps  of  the
        brief-case.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6855"><span data-line="6855"></span>A  heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or
        title on the cover. The print also looked  slightly  irregular.
        The  pages  were  worn at the edges, and fell apart, easily, as
        though the book had passed through many hands. The  inscription
        on the title-page ran:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="6861" style="display:block"><code>         THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF
         OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM
         by
         Emmanuel Goldstein</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="6866"><span data-line="6866"></span>Winston began reading:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="6868" style="display:block"><code>         Chapter I
         Ignorance is Strength</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="6871"><span data-line="6871"></span>Throughout  recorded  time,  and probably since the end of
        the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the
        world, the High, the  Middle,  and  the  Low.  They  have  been
        subdivided  in  many  ways, they have borne countless different
        names, and their relative numbers, as well  as  their  attitude
        towards  one  another,  have  varied  from  age to age: but the
        essential structure of society has never  altered.  Even  after
        enormous  upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same
        pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope  will
        always  return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way
        or the other.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6883"><span data-line="6883"></span>The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable…
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6885"><span data-line="6885"></span>Winston stopped reading, chiefly in  order  to  appreciate
        the  fact that he was reading, in comfort and safety. He
        was alone: no telescreen, no ear at  the  keyhole,  no  nervous
        impulse  to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his
        hand. The sweet summer  air  played  against  his  cheek.  From
        somewhere  far away there floated the faint shouts of children:
        in the room itself there was no sound except the  insect  voice
        of  the clock. He settled deeper into the arm-chair and put his
        feet up on the fender. It was bliss, it was etemity.  Suddenly,
        as  one  sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one
        will ultimately read and re-read every word, he opened it at  a
        different  place  and  found himself at Chapter III. He went on
        reading:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6899"><span data-line="6899"></span>Chapter III
             War is Peace
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6902"><span data-line="6902"></span>The  splitting  up  of  the   world   into   three   great
        super-states  was  an  event  which  could  be  and  indeed was
        foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century.  With  the
        absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by the
        United  States,  two  of the three existing powers, Eurasia and
        Oceania,  were  already  effectively  in  being.   The   third,
        Eastasia,  only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade
        of  confused  fighting.  The  frontiers   between   the   three
        super-states  are  in some places arbitrary, and in others they
        fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general they
        follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole  of  the
        northern  part  of  the  European  and  Asiatic land-mass, from
        Portugal to the Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the  Americas,
        the  Atlantic islands including the British Isles, Australasia,
        and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia, smaller than  the
        others  and  with  a  less definite western frontier, comprises
        China and the countries  to  the  south  of  it,  the  Japanese
        islands  and  a  large  but  fluctuating  portion of Manchuria,
        Mongolia, and Tibet.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6922"><span data-line="6922"></span>In one combination or another,  these  three  super-states
        are  permanently  at  war,  and  have  been  so  for  the  past
        twenty-five years. War, however, is no  longer  the  desperate,
        annihilating  struggle  that it was in the early decades of the
        twentieth centary. It is a  warfare  of  limited  aims  between
        combatants  who  are  unable  to  destroy  one another, have no
        material cause for fighting and are not divided by any  genuine
        ideological  difference.  This  is  not  to say that either the
        conduct of war, or the  prevailing  attitude  towards  it,  has
        become  less  bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary,
        war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries,  and
        such  acts  as  raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the
        reduction  of  whole  populations  to  slavery,  and  reprisals
        against  prisoners  which  extend  even  to boiling and burying
        alive, are looked upon as normal, and, when they are  committed
        by  one<span data-line="6937"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6937"></span>s  own side and not by the enemy, meritorious. But in a
        physical sense war  involves  very  small  numbers  of  people,
        mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few
        casualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the
        vague  frontiers  whose  whereabouts  the  average man can only
        guess  at,  or  round  the  Floating  Fortresses  which   guard
        strategic   spots   on   the  sea  lanes.  In  the  centres  of
        civilization war means no more than a  continuous  shortage  of
        consumption  goods,  and  the occasional crash of a rocket bomb
        which may cause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed
        its character. More exactly, the reasons for which war is waged
        have changed in their order of importance. Motives  which  were
        already  present  to some small extent in the great wars of the
        early twentieth centuary  have  now  become  dominant  and  are
        consciously recognized and acted upon.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6953"><span data-line="6953"></span>To  understand  the  nature  of  the present war — for in
        spite of the regrouping which occurs every  few  years,  it  is
        always the same war — one must realize in the first place that
        it  is  impossible  for  it  to  be decisive. None of the three
        super-states could be definitively conquered even by the  other
        two  in  combination.  They  are  too evenly matched, and their
        natural defences are too formidable. Eurasia  is  protected  by
        its  vast land spaces. Oceania by the width of the Atlantic and
        the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness  of
        its  inhabitants.  Secondly,  there is no longer, in a material
        sense, anything to  fight  about.  With  the  establishment  of
        self-contained  economies,  in which production and consumption
        are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was a
        main cause of previous wars has  come  to  an  end,  while  the
        competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and
        death.  In  any  case each of the three super-states is so vast
        that it can obtain almost  all  the  materials  that  it  needs
        within  its  own  boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct
        economic purpose, it is a war for  labour  power.  Between  the
        frontiers  of  the  super-states,  and not permanently in the
        possession of any of them, there  lies  a  rough  quadrilateral
        with  its  corners  at  Tangier,  Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong
        Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the  population  of
        the  earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated
        regions, and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are
        constantly struggling. In practice no one power  ever  controls
        the  whole  of the disputed area. Portions of it are constantly
        changing hands, and it is the chance of seizing  this  or  that
        fragment  by  a  sudden  stroke  of treachery that dictates the
        endless changes of alignment.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="6984"><span data-line="6984"></span>All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals,
        and some of them yield important  vegetable  products  such  as
        rubber  which  in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize
        by comparatively expensive methods. But above all they  contain
        a  bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever power controls
        equatorial Africa, or the countries  of  the  Middle  East,  or
        Southern India, or the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes also of
        the  bodies  of  scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and
        hard-working coolies. The inhabitants of these  areas,  reduced
        more  or  less openly to the status of slaves, pass continually
        from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended like so much coal
        or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capture  more
        territory,  to  control  more  labour  power,  to turn out more
        armaments, to capture more territory, and so  on  indefinitely.
        It  should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond
        the edges of the disputed areas. The frontiers of Eurasia  flow
        back  and forth between the basin of the Congo and the northern
        shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the Indian Ocean and
        the Pacific are constantly being  captured  and  recaptured  by
        Oceania  or  by Eastasia; in Mongolia the dividing line between
        Eurasia and Eastasia is never stable; round the Pole all  three
        powers  lay  claim  to  enormous  territories which in fact are
        largely unihabited and unexplored: but  the  balance  of  power
        always  remains roughly even, and the territory which forms the
        heartland  of  each  super-state  always   remains   inviolate.
        Moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator
        is  not  really  necessary  to  the  world<span data-line="7010"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7010"></span>s  economy. They add
        nothing to the wealth of the world, since whatever they produce
        is used for purposes of war, and the object of waging a war  is
        always to be in a better position in which to wage another war.
        By  their  labour  the  slave  populations  allow  the tempo of
        continuous warfare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist,
        the structure of world society, and the  process  by  which  it
        maintains itself, would not be essentially different.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7019"><span data-line="7019"></span>The  primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the
        principles of doublethink, this  aim  is  simultaneously
        recognized  and  not  recognized by the directing brains of the
        Inner Party) is to use up the products of the  machine  without
        raising  the  general standard of living. Ever since the end of
        the nineteenth century, the problem of  what  to  do  with  the
        surplus  of  consumption  goods  has  been latent in industrial
        society. At present, when few human beings even have enough  to
        eat,  this  problem  is  obviously not urgent, and it might not
        have become so, even if no artificial processes of  destruction
        had  been  at  work.  The  world  of  today  is a bare, hungry,
        dilapidated place compared with the world that  existed  before
        1914,  and  still more so if compared with the imaginary future
        to which the people of that period looked forward. In the early
        twentieth century, the vision of a future society  unbelievably
        rich,   leisured,   orderly,  and  efficient  —  a  glittering
        antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete  —
        was  part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person.
        Science and technology were developing at a  prodigious  speed,
        and  it  seemed  natural  to  assume  that  they  would  go  on
        developing. This  failed  to  happen,  partly  because  of  the
        impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions,
        partly  because  scientific  and technical progress depended on
        the empirical habit of thought, which could not  survive  in  a
        strictly  regimented  society.  As  a  whole  the world is more
        primitive today than it was fifty years ago.  Certain  backward
        areas  have  advanced,  and various devices, always in some way
        connected  with  warfare  and  police  espionage,   have   been
        developed,  but  experiment and invention have largely stopped,
        and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have
        never been fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in
        the machine are still there. From the moment when  the  machine
        first  made  its appearance it was clear to all thinking people
        that the need for human drudgery,  and  therefore  to  a  great
        extent  for  human  inequality, had disappeared. If the machine
        were used deliberately for that end,  hunger,  overwork,  dirt,
        illiteracy,  and  disease  could  be  eliminated  within  a few
        generations. And in fact,  without  being  used  for  any  such
        purpose,  but  by  a  sort of automatic process — by producing
        wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to  distribute  —
        the  machine  did  raise  the  living  standards of the average
        humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at
        the end of the nineteenth and the beginning  of  the  twentieth
        centuries.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7064"><span data-line="7064"></span>But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth
        threatened  the  destruction  —  indeed, in some sense was the
        destruction — of a hierarchical society. In a world  in  which
        everyone  worked  short  hours,  had  enough to eat, lived in a
        house with a bathroom  and  a  refrigerator,  and  possessed  a
        motor-car  or  even  an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps
        the most  important  form  of  inequality  would  already  have
        disappeared.  If it once became general, wealth would confer no
        distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in
        which wealth, in the sense of personal  possessions  and
        luxuries,  should  be  evenly  distributed,  while power
        remained in the hands of  a  small  privileged  caste.  But  in
        practice  such  a  society could not long remain stable. For if
        leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great  mass
        of  human  beings  who  are normally stupefied by poverty would
        become literate and would learn to think  for  themselves;  and
        when  once  they  had  done  this,  they  would sooner or later
        realize that the privileged minority had no function, and  they
        would  sweep  it  away. In the long run, a hierarchical society
        was only possible on a  basis  of  poverty  and  ignorance.  To
        return  to  the  agricultural  past, as some thinkers about the
        beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not  a
        practicable  solution.  It conflicted with the tendency towards
        mechanization which  had  become  quasi-instinctive  throughout
        almost  the  whole  world,  and  moreover,  any  country  which
        remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense
        and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly,  by  its
        more advanced rivals.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7093"><span data-line="7093"></span>Nor  was  it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in
        poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to  a
        great  extent  during  the  final  phase of capitalism, roughly
        between 1920 and  1940.  The  economy  of  many  countries  was
        allowed  to  stagnate,  land  went  out of cultivation, capital
        equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were
        prevented from working and kept half alive  by  State  charity.
        But  this,  too,  entailed  military  weakness,  and  since the
        privations it inflicted were  obviously  unnecessary,  it  made
        opposition  inevitable.  The problem was how to keep the wheels
        of industry turning without increasing the real wealth  of  the
        world.   Goods   must   be  produced,  but  they  must  not  be
        distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was
        by continuous warfare.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7108"><span data-line="7108"></span>The essential act of war is destruction,  not  necessarily
        of  human  lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a
        way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the  stratosphere,
        or  sinking  in  the  depths  of the sea, materials which might
        otherwise be used to  make  the  masses  too  comfortable,  and
        hence,  in  the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of
        war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture  is  still  a
        convenient  way  of  expending  labour  power without producing
        anything  that  can  be  consumed.  A  Floating  Fortress,  for
        example,  has  locked  up  in  it  the  labour that would build
        several hundred  cargo-ships.  Ultimately  it  is  scrapped  as
        obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody,
        and  with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is
        built. In principle the war effort is always so planned  as  to
        eat  up  any  surplus  that  might exist after meeting the bare
        needs  of  the  population.  In  practice  the  needs  of   the
        population  are  always  underestimated,  with  the result that
        there is a chronic shortage of half the  necessities  of  life;
        but  this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy
        to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near  the  brink  of
        hardship,  because  a  general  state of scarcity increases the
        importance  of  small  privileges  and   thus   magnifies   the
        distinction  between one group and another. By the standards of
        the early twentieth century, even a member of the  Inner  Party
        lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few
        luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the
        better  texture  of his clothes, the better quality of his food
        and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants,  his  private
        motor-car  or helicopter — set him in a different world from a
        member of the Outer Party, and the members of the  Outer  Party
        have  a  similar  advantage  in  comparison  with the submerged
        masses whom we call <span data-line="7139"></span>&#8216;_the proles&#8217;<span data-line="7139"></span>. The social atmosphere is that
        of  a  besieged  city,  where  the  possession  of  a  lump  of
        horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And
        at  the  same  time  the  consciousness  of  being  at war, and
        therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power  to  a
        small   caste   seem  the  natural,  unavoidable  condition  of
        survival.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7147"><span data-line="7147"></span>War,  it  will  be  seen,   accomplishes   the   necessary
        destruction,   but   accomplishes   it   in  a  psychologically
        acceptable way. In principle it would be quite simple to  waste
        the  surplus  labour  of  the  world  by  building  temples and
        pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again,  or  even
        by  producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to
        them. But this would provide only  the  economic  and  not  the
        emotional  basis  for a hierarchical society. What is concerned
        here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant
        so long as they are kept steadily at work, but  the  morale  of
        the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is expected to
        be  competent,  industrious, and even intelligent within narrow
        limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a  credulous
        and  ignorant  fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred,
        adulation,  and  orgiastic  triumph.  In  other  words  it   is
        necessary  that  he  should have the mentality appropriate to a
        state of war. It does not matter whether the  war  is  actually
        happening,  and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does
        not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that  is
        needed  is  that  a state of war should exist. The splitting of
        the intelligence which the Party requires of its  members,  and
        which  is  more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war, is now
        almost universal, but the higher up the  ranks  one  goes,  the
        more marked it becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Party that
        war  hysteria  and  hatred  of  the enemy are strongest. In his
        capacity as an administrator,  it  is  often  necessary  for  a
        member of the Inner Party to know that this or that item of war
        news  is  untruthful, and he may often be aware that the entire
        war is spurious and is either not happening or is  being  waged
        for  purposes  quite  other  than  the  declared ones: but such
        knowledge  is  easily   neutralized   by   the   technique   of
        doublethink.  Meanwhile no Inner Party member wavers for
        an instant in his mystical belief that the war is  real,
        and  that  it  is  bound  to end victoriously, with Oceania the
        undisputed master of the entire world.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7183"><span data-line="7183"></span>All members of the Inner  Party  believe  in  this  coming
        conquest as an article of faith. It is to be achieved either by
        gradually  acquiring more and more territory and so building up
        an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by the discovery  of
        some  new  and  unanswerable weapon. The search for new weapons
        continues unceasingly, and is one of  the  very  few  remaining
        activities  in  which the inventive or speculative type of mind
        can find any outlet. In Oceania at the present day, Science, in
        the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is
        no word for <span data-line="7192"></span>&#8216;_Science&#8217;<span data-line="7192"></span>. The  empirical  method  of  thought,  on
        which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded,
        is  opposed  to  the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And
        even technological progress only happens when its products  can
        in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In all
        the  useful  arts  the  world is either standing still or going
        backwards. The fields are cultivated with  horse-ploughs  while
        books  are  written  by  machinery.  But  in  matters  of vital
        importance — meaning, in effect, war and police  espionage  —
        the  empirical  approach  is  still  encouraged,  or  at  least
        tolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer  the  whole
        surface  of  the  earth  and to extinguish once and for all the
        possibility of independent thought.  There  are  therefore  two
        great  problems  which  the Party is concerned to solve. One is
        how to discover, against his will, what another human being  is
        thinking,  and the other is how to kill several hundred million
        people in a few seconds without giving warning  beforehand.  In
        so  far  as  scientific  research  still continues, this is its
        subject matter. The scientist of today is either a  mixture  of
        psychologist   and  inquisitor,  studying  with  real  ordinary
        minuteness the meaning of  facial  expressions,  gestures,  and
        tones  of  voice,  and  testing  the truth-producing effects of
        drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he  is
        chemist,  physicist,  or  biologist  concerned  only  with such
        branches of his special subject as are relevant to  the  taking
        of life. In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of Peace, and
        in  the  experimental stations hidden in the Brazilian forests,
        or in  the  Australian  desert,  or  on  lost  islands  of  the
        Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some
        are  concerned  simply  with  planning  the logistics of future
        wars; others devise larger and larger rocket  bombs,  more  and
        more  powerful  explosives,  and  more  and  more  impenetrable
        armour- plating; others search for new and deadlier  gases,  or
        for   soluble   poisons  capable  of  being  produced  in  such
        quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or
        for breeds of disease  germs  immunized  against  all  possible
        antibodies;  others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore
        its way under the soil like a submarine under the water, or  an
        aeroplane  as independent of its base as a sailing-ship; others
        explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing  the  sun<span data-line="7231"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7231"></span>s
        rays  through  lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in
        space, or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal  waves  by
        tapping the heat at the earth<span data-line="7234"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7234"></span>s centre.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7236"><span data-line="7236"></span>But  none  of  these  projects  ever  comes  anywhere near
        realization, and none of the three super-states  ever  gains  a
        significant lead on the others. What is more remarkable is that
        all  three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb, a weapon
        far more powerful than any that their  present  researches  are
        likely to discover. Although the Party, according to its habit,
        claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as
        early  as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large
        scale about ten years later. At  that  time  some  hundreds  of
        bombs  were  dropped on industrial centres, chiefly in European
        Russia, Western Europe, and North America. The  effect  was  to
        convince  the  ruling  groups  of all countries that a few more
        atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society, and hence
        of their own power. Thereafter, although  no  formal  agreement
        was  ever  made  or  hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All
        three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and  store
        them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe
        will  come  sooner  or  later. And meanwhile the art of war has
        remained  almost  stationary  for  thirty   or   forty   years.
        Helicopters  are  more  used  than  they were formerly, bombing
        planes  have  been   largely   superseded   by   self-propelled
        projectiles,  and  the fragile movable battleship has given way
        to the almost unsinkable Floating Fortress; but otherwise there
        has been little  development.  The  tank,  the  submarine,  the
        torpedo,  the  machine gun, even the rifle and the hand grenade
        are still in use.  And  in  spite  of  the  endless  slaughters
        reported  in  the  Press  and on the telescreens, the desperate
        battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of thousands or even
        millions of men were often killed in a few  weeks,  have  never
        been repeated.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7267"><span data-line="7267"></span>None of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre
        which  involves  the  risk  of  serious  defeat. When any large
        operation is  undertaken,  it  is  usually  a  surprise  attack
        against  an  ally.  The  strategy  that  all  three  powers are
        following, or pretend to themselves that they are following, is
        the  same.  The  plan  is,  by  a  combination   of   fighting,
        bargaining,  and  well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a
        ring of bases completely encircling one or other of  the  rival
        states,  and  then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival
        and remain on peaceful terms for  so  many  years  as  to  lull
        suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with atomic
        bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they
        will  all  be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating
        as to make retaliation impossible. It will then be time to sign
        a  pact  of  friendship  with  the  remaining  world-power,  in
        preparation  for  another  attack.  This  scheme,  it is hardly
        necessary  to  say,  is  a   mere   daydream,   impossible   of
        realization.  Moreover,  no  fighting ever occurs except in the
        disputed areas round the Equator and the Pole: no  invasion  of
        enemy territory is ever undertaken. This explains the fact that
        in  some  places  the  frontiers  between  the  superstates are
        arbitrary. Eurasia,  for  example,  could  easily  conquer  the
        British  Isles,  which are geographically part of Europe, or on
        the other hand it would be possible for  Oceania  to  push  its
        frontiers  to  the Rhine or even to the Vistula. But this would
        violate the principle,  followed  on  all  sides  though  never
        formulated,  of  cultural integrity. If Oceania were to conquer
        the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany,  it
        would  be  necessary  either  to exterminate the inhabitants, a
        task  of  great  physical  difficulty,  or  to   assimilate   a
        population  of  about  a hundred million people, who, so far as
        technical development goes, are roughly on the  Oceanic  level.
        The  problem  is  the  same  for  all three super-states. It is
        absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no
        contact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with  war
        prisoners  and  coloured  slaves. Even the official ally of the
        moment is always  regarded  with  the  darkest  suspicion.  War
        prisoners apart, the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes
        on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia, and he is forbidden
        the  knowledge of foreign languages. If he were allowed contact
        with foreigners he  would  discover  that  they  are  creatures
        similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about
        them  is  lies.  The  sealed  world  in which he lives would be
        broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness  on  which
        his morale depends might evaporate. It is therefore realized on
        all  sides  that  however  often  Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or
        Ceylon may change hands,  the  main  frontiers  must  never  be
        crossed by anything except bombs.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7316"><span data-line="7316"></span>Under  this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly
        understood and acted upon: namely, that the conditions of  life
        in  all  three  super-states are very much the same. In Oceania
        the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc, in  Eurasia  it  is
        called  Neo-Bolshevism,  and  in  Eastasia  it  is  called by a
        Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but  perhaps
        better  rendered  as  Obliteration  of the Self. The citizen of
        Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the  tenets  of  the
        other  two  philosophies,  but he is taught to execrate them as
        barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense. Actually the
        three philosophies are barely distinguishable, and  the  social
        systems  which  they  support  are  not distinguishable at all.
        Everywhere there is the  same  pyramidal  structure,  the  same
        worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and
        for  continuous warfare. It follows that the three super-states
        not  only  cannot  conquer  one  another,  but  would  gain  no
        advantage  by doing so. On the contrary, so long as they remain
        in conflict they prop one another up,  like  three  sheaves  of
        corn.  And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are
        simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing.  Their
        lives  are dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that
        it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly  and
        without  victory.  Meanwhile  the  fact that there is no
        danger of conquest makes possible the denial of  reality  which
        is  the  special  feature  of  Ingsoc  and its rival systems of
        thought. Here it is necessary to  repeat  what  has  been  said
        earlier,  that  by  becoming  continuous  war has fundamentally
        changed its character.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7345"><span data-line="7345"></span>In past ages, a war, almost by definition,  was  something
        that  sooner  or  later came to an end, usually in unmistakable
        victory or defeat. In the past, also, war was one of  the  main
        instruments  by  which  human societies were kept in touch with
        physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried to impose a
        false view of the world upon their followers,  but  they  could
        not  afford  to  encourage  any  illusion that tended to impair
        military efficiency. So  long  as  defeat  meant  the  loss  of
        independence,  or  some  other  result  generally  held  to  be
        undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be  serious.
        Physical   facts  could  not  be  ignored.  In  philosophy,  or
        religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make  five,
        but  when  one  was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to
        make four. Inefficient nations were always conquered sooner  or
        later,   and  the  struggle  for  efficiency  was  inimical  to
        illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it  was  necessary  to  be
        able  to  learn  from  the  past,  which  meant having a fairly
        accurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers  and
        history  books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but
        falsification of the kind that is practised  today  would  have
        been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far
        as  the  ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most
        important of all safeguards. While wars could be won  or  lost,
        no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7370"><span data-line="7370"></span>But  when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases
        to be dangerous. When war is continuous there is no such  thing
        as  military  necessity.  Technical  progress can cease and the
        most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded.  As  we  have
        seen,  researches  that  could  be  called scientific are still
        carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a
        kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results  is  not
        important.  Efficiency,  even military efficiency, is no longer
        needed. Nothing is efficient  in  Oceania  except  the  Thought
        Police.  Since each of the three super-states is unconquerable,
        each is in effect a separate universe within which  almost  any
        perversion  of  thought  can  be safely practised. Reality only
        exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life  —  the
        need  to  eat  and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid
        swallowing poison or stepping out of  top-storey  windows,  and
        the like. Between life and death, and between physical pleasure
        and  physical  pain,  there is still a distinction, but that is
        all. Cut off from contact with the outer world,  and  with  the
        past,  the  citizen  of  Oceania  is like a man in interstellar
        space, who has no way of knowing  which  direction  is  up  and
        which  is down. The rulers of such a state are absolute, as the
        Pharaohs or the Caesars could  not  be.  They  are  obliged  to
        prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large
        enough  to  be  inconvenient, and they are obliged to remain at
        the same low level of military technique as their  rivals;  but
        once  that  minimum  is  achieved,  they can twist reality into
        whatever shape they choose.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7398"><span data-line="7398"></span>The war, therefore, if we judge it  by  the  standards  of
        previous  wars,  is merely an imposture. It is like the battles
        between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an
        angle that they are  incapable  of  hurting  one  another.  But
        though  it  is  unreal  it  is  not meaningless. It eats up the
        surplus of consumable goods,  and  it  helps  to  preserve  the
        special  mental  atmosphere  that a hierarchical society needs.
        War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair.  In  the
        past,  the  ruling groups of all countries, although they might
        recognize  their  common  interest  and  therefore  limit   the
        destructiveness  of war, did fight against one another, and the
        victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are
        not fighting against one another at all. The war  is  waged  by
        each  ruling  group against its own subjects, and the object of
        the war is not to make or prevent conquests of  territory,  but
        to  keep  the structure of society intact. The very word <span data-line="7413"></span>&#8216;_war&#8217;<span data-line="7413"></span>,
        therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate
        to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The
        peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings  between  the
        Neolithic  Age  and the early twentieth century has disappeared
        and been replaced by  something  quite  different.  The  effect
        would  be  much  the same if the three super-states, instead of
        fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual  peace,
        each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each
        would  still  be a self-contained universe, freed for ever from
        the sobering influence of external danger.  A  peace  that  was
        truly  permanent  would be the same as a permanent war. This —
        although the vast majority of Party members understand it  only
        in  a  shallower  sense  —  is  the inner meaning of the Party
        slogan: War is Peace.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7429"><span data-line="7429"></span>Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in  remote
        distance a rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feeling of being
        alone  with  the  forbidden book, in a room with no telescreen,
        had not worn off. Solitude and safety were physical sensations,
        mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body,  the  softness
        of  the  chair,  the  touch of the faint breeze from the window
        that played upon his cheek. The book fascinated  him,  or  more
        exactly  it  reassured him. In a sense it told him nothing that
        was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said  what  he
        would  have  said,  if  it had been possible for him to set his
        scattered thoughts in order. It  was  the  product  of  a  mind
        similar   to  his  own,  but  enormously  more  powerful,  more
        systematic, less fear-ridden. The best books, he perceived, are
        those that tell you what you know already. He had  just  turned
        back  to  Chapter I when he heard Julia<span data-line="7443"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7443"></span>s footstep on the stair
        and started out of his chair to meet her. She dumped her  brown
        tool-bag  on  the floor and flung herself into his arms. It was
        more than a week since they had seen one another.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7448"><span data-line="7448"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I&#39;ve got the book,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="7448"></span> he said as  they  disentangled
        themselves.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7451"><span data-line="7451"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oh, you&#39;ve got it? Good,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="7451"></span> she said without much interest,
        and almost  immediately  knelt down beside the oilstove to make
        the coffee.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7455"><span data-line="7455"></span>They did not return to the subject until they had been  in
        bed  for half an hour. The evening was just cool enough to make
        it worth while to pull up the counterpane. From below came  the
        familiar  sound  of  singing  and  the  scrape  of boots on the
        flagstones. The brawny red-armed woman whom  Winston  had  seen
        there  on  his  first  visit  was almost a fixture in the yard.
        There seemed to be  no  hour  of  daylight  when  she  was  not
        marching   to  and  fro  between  the  washtub  and  the  line,
        alternately gagging herself  with  clothes  pegs  and  breaking
        forth  into  lusty song. Julia had settled down on her side and
        seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep. He reached
        out for the book, which was lying on  the  floor,  and  sat  up
        against the bedhead.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7469"><span data-line="7469"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We  must  read it,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="7469"></span> he said. <span data-line="7469"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You too. All members of the
        Brotherhood have to read it.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="7470"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7472"><span data-line="7472"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You read it,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="7472"></span> she said  with  her  eyes  shut.  <span data-line="7472"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Read  it
        aloud.  That&#39;s  the  best way. Then you can explain it to me as
        you go.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="7474"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7476"><span data-line="7476"></span>The clock<span data-line="7476"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7476"></span>s hands said six,  meaning  eighteen.  They  had
        three  or four hours ahead of them. He propped the book against
        his knees and began reading:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7480"><span data-line="7480"></span>Chapter I
             Ignorance is Strength
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7483"><span data-line="7483"></span>Throughout recorded time, and probably since  the  end  of
        the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the
        world,  the  High,  the  Middle,  and  the  Low. They have been
        subdivided in many ways, they have  borne  countless  different
        names,  and  their  relative numbers, as well as their attitude
        towards one another, have varied  from  age  to  age:  but  the
        essential  structure  of  society has never altered. Even after
        enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the  same
        pattern  has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will
        always return to equilibnum, however far it is pushed  one  way
        or the other
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7495"><span data-line="7495"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Julia, are you awake?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="7495"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7497"><span data-line="7497"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes, my love, I&#39;m listening. Go on. It&#39;s marvellous.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="7497"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7499"><span data-line="7499"></span>He continued reading:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7501"><span data-line="7501"></span>The    aims   of   these   three   groups   are   entirely
        irreconcilable. The aim of the High is  to  remain  where  they
        are.  The  aim of the Middle is to change places with the High.
        The aim of the Low, when they have an  aim  —  for  it  is  an
        abiding  characteristic  of  the  Low  that  they  are too much
        crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of
        anything outside  their  daily  lives  —  is  to  abolish  all
        distinctions  and  create  a  society in which all men shall be
        equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same  in
        its  main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods
        the High seem to be securely in  power,  but  sooner  or  later
        there  always comes a moment when they lose either their belief
        in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both.
        They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the  Low  on
        their  side  by  pretending  to them that they are fighting for
        liberty and  justice.  As  soon  as  they  have  reached  their
        objective,  the  Middle  thrust  the  Low  back  into their old
        position  of  servitude,  and  themselves  become   the   High.
        Presently  a  new Middle group splits off from one of the other
        groups, or from both of them,  and  the  struggle  begins  over
        again.  Of  the  three  groups,  only  the  Low  are never even
        temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be  an
        exaggeration  to  say that throughout history there has been no
        progress of a  material  kind.  Even  today,  in  a  period  of
        decline,  the average human being is physically better off than
        he was a few centuries  ago.  But  no  advance  in  wealth,  no
        softening  of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought
        human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of  view  of
        the  Low,  no  historic  change has ever meant much more than a
        change in the name of their masters.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7532"><span data-line="7532"></span>By the late nineteenth  century  the  recurrence  of  this
        pattern  had  become obvious to many observers. There then rose
        schools of thinkers  who  interpreted  history  as  a  cyclical
        process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable
        law of human life. This doctrine, of course, had always had its
        adherents,  but  in  the manner in which it was now put forward
        there was a significant change. In the  past  the  need  for  a
        hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically
        of  the High. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats and
        by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon
        them, and  it  had  generally  been  softened  by  promises  of
        compensation  in  an  imaginary  world  beyond  the  grave. The
        Middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had always made
        use of such terms as freedom,  justice,  and  fraternity.  Now,
        however,  the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed
        by people who were not yet in positions of command, but  merely
        hoped  to  be  so  before long. In the past the Middle had made
        revolutions under the banner of equality, and  then  had<span data-line="7549"></span><br>
<span data-line="7550"></span>        established  a  fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown.
        The new  Middle  groups  in  effect  proclaimed  their  tyranny
        beforehand.  Socialism,  a  theory  which appeared in the early
        nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of  thought
        stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, was still
        deeply  infected  by  the  Utopianism of past ages. But in each
        variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards  the
        aim  of  establishing  liberty  and  equality was more and more
        openly abandoned. The  new  movements  which  appeared  in  the
        middle  years of the century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism
        in  Eurasia,  Death-Worship,  as  it  is  commonly  called,  in
        Eastasia,  had  the conscious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and
        inequality. These new movements, of course, grew out of the old
        ones and tended to keep their  names  and  pay  lip-service  to
        their  ideology.  But  the purpose of all of them was to arrest
        progress and freeze history at a chosen  moment.  The  familiar
        pendulum  swing  was  to  happen  once  more, and then stop. As
        usual, the High were to be turned out by the Middle, who  would
        then become the High; but this time, by conscious strategy, the
        High would be able to maintain their position permanently.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7571"><span data-line="7571"></span>The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation
        of historical  knowledge,  and  the  growth  of  the historical
        sense, which had hardly existed before the nineteenth  century.
        The  cyclical  movement  of  history  was  now intelligible, or
        appeared to be so; and if it  was  intelligible,  then  it  was
        alterable.  But  the  principal,  underlying cause was that, as
        early as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality
        had become technically possible. It was  still  true  that  men
        were  not  equal in their native talents and that functions had
        to be  specialized  in  ways  that  favoured  some  individuals
        against others; but there was no longer any real need for class
        distinctions  or  for  large  differences of wealth. In earlier
        ages, class distinctions  had  been  not  only  inevitable  but
        desirable.  Inequality  was the price of civilization. With the
        development  of  machine  production,  however,  the  case  was
        altered.  Even if it was still necessary for human beings to do
        different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for them to
        live at different social or economic  levels.  Therefore,  from
        the  point  of  view of the new groups who were on the point of
        seizing power, human equality was no  longer  an  ideal  to  be
        striven  after,  but  a danger to be averted. In more primitive
        ages, when  a  just  and  peaceful  society  was  in  fact  not
        possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of an
        earthly  paradise  in which men should live together in a state
        of brotherhood, without laws  and  without  brute  labour,  had
        haunted  the human imagination for thousands of years. And this
        vision had had a certain hold even on the groups  who  actually
        profited  by  each  historical change. The heirs of the French,
        English, and American revolutions had partly believed in  their
        own  phrases  about  the  rights  of  man,  freedom  of speech,
        equality before the law, and the like, and  have  even  allowed
        their  conduct  to be influenced by them to some extent. But by
        the fourth  decade  of  the  twentieth  century  all  the  main
        currents  of  political thought were authoritarian. The earthly
        paradise had been discredited at exactly  the  moment  when  it
        became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever name
        it  called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And
        in the general hardening of outlook that  set  in  round  about
        1930,  practices  which  had been long abandoned, in some cases
        for hundreds of years — imprisonment without trial, the use of
        war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to  extract
        confessions,  the use of hostages, and the deportation of whole
        populations-not only became common again,  but  were  tolerated
        and   even   defended   by  people  who  considered  themselves
        enlightened and progressive.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7617"><span data-line="7617"></span>It was only after a decade of national wars,  civil  wars,
        revolutions,  and counter-revolutions in all parts of the world
        that  Ingsoc  and  its  rivals  emerged  as  fully   worked-out
        political  theories.  But  they  had  been  foreshadowed by the
        various  systems,  generally  called  totalitarian,  which  had
        appeared  earlier  in the century, and the main outlines of the
        world which would emerge from the  prevailing  chaos  had  long
        been  obvious. What kind of people would control this world had
        been equally obvious. The new aristocracy was made up  for  the
        most  part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade-union
        organizers,   publicity   experts,   sociologists,    teachers,
        journalists,  and professional politicians. These people, whose
        origins lay in the salaried middle class and the  upper  grades
        of  the  working class, had been shaped and brought together by
        the  barren  world  of  monopoly   industry   and   centralized
        government.  As  compared  with  their opposite numbers in past
        ages, they  were  less  avaricious,  less  tempted  by  luxury,
        hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what
        they  were  doing  and more intent on crushing opposition. This
        last difference was cardinal. By comparison with that  existing
        today,  all  the  tyrannies  of  the past were half-hearted and
        inefficient. The ruling groups were  always  infected  to  some
        extent  by  liberal ideas, and were content to leave loose ends
        everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested
        in what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic  Church
        of  the  Middle  Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of
        the reason for this was that in the past no government had  the
        power  to  keep  its  citizens under constant surveillance. The
        invention of print,  however,  made  it  easier  to  manipulate
        public  opinion, and the film and the radio carried the process
        further. With the development of television, and the  technical
        advance   which  made  it  possible  to  receive  and  transmit
        simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to  an
        end.  Every citizen, or at least every citizen important enough
        to be worth watching, could be kept for twentyfour hours a  day
        under  the  eyes  of  the  police  and in the sound of official
        propaganda, with all other channels  of  communication  closed.
        The possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the
        will  of  the  State, but complete uniformity of opinion on all
        subjects, now existed for the first time.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7658"><span data-line="7658"></span>After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties,
        society regrouped itself, as always,  into  High,  Middle,  and
        Low.  But  the  new High group, unlike all its forerunners, did
        not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard its
        position. It had long been realized that the only secure  basis
        for  oligarchy  is  collectivism. Wealth and privilege are most
        easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The  so-called
        <span data-line="7665"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">abolition  of private property</em>&#8217;<span data-line="7665"></span> which took place in the middle
        years of the century meant, in  effect,  the  concentration  of
        property  in  far  fewer  hands  than  before:  but  with  this
        difference, that the new owners were a group instead of a  mass
        of  individuals.  Individually,  no  member  of  the Party owns
        anything, except petty personal belongings.  Collectively,  the
        Party   owns   everything   in  Oceania,  because  it  controls
        everything, and disposes of the products as it thinks  fit.  In
        the  years  following  the  Revolution it was able to step into
        this commanding position almost unopposed,  because  the  whole
        process  was  represented as an act of collectivization. It had
        always  been  assumed  that  if  the  capitalist   class   were
        expropriated,  Socialism  must  follow:  and unquestionably the
        capitalists had  been  expropriated.  Factories,  mines,  land,
        houses,  transport — everything had been taken away from them:
        and since these things were  no  longer  private  property,  it
        followed  that they must be public property. Ingsoc, which grew
        out  of  the  earlier  Socialist  movement  and  inherited  its
        phraseology,  has  in  fact  carried  out  the main item in the
        Socialist programme; with the  result,  foreseen  and  intended
        beforehand, that economic inequality has been made permanent.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7687"><span data-line="7687"></span>But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go
        deeper  than  this.  There are only four ways in which a ruling
        group can fall from power. Either it is conquered from without,
        or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are  stirred  to
        revolt,  or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to
        come into being,  or  it  loses  its  own  self-confidence  and
        willingness  to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and
        as a rule all four of them are present in some degree. A ruling
        class which could guard against all of  them  would  remain  in
        power  permanently.  Ultimately  the  determining factor is the
        mental attitude of the ruling class itself.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7699"><span data-line="7699"></span>After the middle of the present century, the first  danger
        had  in reality disappeared. Each of the three powers which now
        divide the world is  in  fact  unconquerable,  and  could  only
        become  conquerable  through  slow  demographic changes which a
        government with  wide  powers  can  easily  avert.  The  second
        danger,  also,  is  only  a  theoretical  one. The masses never
        revolt of their  own  accord,  and  they  never  revolt  merely
        because  they  are  oppressed.  Indeed, so long as they are not
        permitted to have standards  of  comparison,  they  never  even
        become  aware  that  they are oppressed. The recurrent economic
        crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are  not  now
        permitted  to  happen, but other and equally large dislocations
        can and do happen without  having  political  results,  because
        there  is  no way in which discontent can become articulate. As
        fcr the problem of overproduction, which has been latent in our
        society since the  development  of  machine  technique,  it  is
        solved  by  the device of continuous warfare (see Chapter III),
        which is  also  useful  in  keying  up  public  morale  to  the
        necessary  pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers,
        therefore, the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of  a
        new group of able, under-employed, power-hungry people, and the
        growth of liberalism and scepticism in  their  own  ranks.  The
        problem,  that  is  to  say, is educational. It is a problem of
        continuously moulding the consciousness both of  the  directing
        group  and  of the larger executive group that lies immediately
        below it. The consciousness of the  masses  needs  only  to  be
        influenced in a negative way.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7727"><span data-line="7727"></span>Given  this  background,  one  could infer, if one did not
        know it already, the general structure of Oceanic  society.  At
        the  apex  of  the  pyramid  comes  Big Brother. Big Brother is
        infallible and all-powerful. Every success, every  achievement,
        every  victory,  every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all
        wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to  issue  directly
        from  his  leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seen Big
        Brother. He is  a  face  on  the  hoardings,  a  voice  on  the
        telescreen.  We  may be reasonably sure that he will never die,
        and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was
        born. Big Brother is the guise in which the  Party  chooses  to
        exhibit  itself  to  the  world.  His  function  is to act as a
        focusing point for love, fear, and  reverence,  emotions  which
        are  more  easily  felt  towards  an individual than towards an
        organization. Below Big Brother  comes  the  Inner  Party.  its
        numbers  limited  to six millions, or something less than 2 per
        cent of the population of Oceania. Below the Inner Party  comes
        the  Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is described as the
        brain of the State, may be justly likened to the  hands.  Below
        that  come  the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as <span data-line="7746"></span>&#8216;_the
        proles&#8217;<span data-line="7747"></span>, numbering perhaps 85 per cent of  the  population.  In
        the  terms  of  our  earlier classification, the proles are the
        Low: for the slave population of the equatorial lands who  pass
        constantly  from conqueror to conqueror, are not a permanent or
        necessary part of the structure.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7753"><span data-line="7753"></span>In principle, membership of  these  three  groups  is  not
        hereditary.  The  child of Inner Party parents is in theory not
        born into the Inner Party. Admission to either  branch  of  the
        Party  is  by  examination, taken at the age of sixteen. Nor is
        there any racial discrimination, or any  marked  domination  of
        one province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans of pure
        Indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the Party,
        and  the  administrators  of any area are always drawn from the
        inhabitants of  that  area.  In  no  part  of  Oceania  do  the
        inhabitants   have   the  feeling  that  they  are  a  colonial
        population  ruled  from  a  distant  capital.  Oceania  has  no
        capital,  and  its  titular  head is a person whose whereabouts
        nobody knows.  Except  that  English  is  its  chief  lingua
        franca  and  Newspeak  its  official  language,  it  is not
        centralized in any way. Its rulers are  not  held  together  by
        blood-ties  but  by  adherence to a common doctrine. It is true
        that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7771"><span data-line="7771"></span>what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines. There is far
        less to- and-fro movement between  the  different  groups  than
        happened  under  capitalism  or even in the pre-industrial age.
        Between the two branches of the Party there is a certain amount
        of interchange, but only so much as will ensure that  weaklings
        are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious members of
        the  Outer  Party  are  made harmless by allowing them to rise.
        Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate into the
        Party. The most gifted among them, who  might  possibly  become
        nuclei  of  discontent,  are  simply marked down by the Thought
        Police and  eliminated.  But  this  state  of  affairs  is  not
        necessarily  permanent,  nor  is  it a matter of principle. The
        Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It does  not
        aim  at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if
        there were no other way of keeping the  ablest  people  at  the
        top,  it  would  be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new
        generation from the ranks of the proletariat.  In  the  crucial
        years,  the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did a
        great  deal  to  neutralize  opposition.  The  older  kind   of
        Socialist,  who  had  been  trained  to fight against something
        called <span data-line="7791"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">class privilege</em>&#8217;<span data-line="7791"></span> assumed that what  is  not  hereditary
        cannot  be  permanent. He did not see that the continuity of an
        oligarchy need not be physical, nor did  he  pause  to  reflect
        that  hereditary  aristocracies  have  always  been shortlived,
        whereas adoptive organizations such as the Catholic Church have
        sometimes lasted  for  hundreds  or  thousands  of  years.  The
        essence  of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance,
        but the persistence of a certain world-view and a  certain  way
        of life, imposed by the dead upon the living. A ruling group is
        a  ruling  group so long as it can nominate its successors. The
        Party is not concerned with perpetuating  its  blood  but  with
        perpetuating  itself. Who wields power is not important,
        provided that the hierarchical  structure  remains  always  the
        same.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7806"><span data-line="7806"></span>All   the   beliefs,   habits,  tastes,  emotions,  mental
        attitudes that characterize our time  are  really  designed  to
        sustain  the  mystique of the Party and prevent the true nature
        of  present-day  society   from   being   perceived.   Physical
        rebellion,  or  any  preliminary  move towards rebellion, is at
        present not possible. From the proletarians nothing  is  to  be
        feared.  Left to themselves, they will continue from generation
        to generation and from century to century,  working,  breeding,
        and  dying,  not only without any impulse to rebel, but without
        the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is.
        They could only become dangerous if the advance  of  industrial
        technique  made  it necessary to educate them more highly; but,
        since military and commercial rivalry are no longer  important,
        the  level  of  popular education is actually declining. What
        opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is  looked  on  as  a
        matter  of  indifference.  They  can  be  granted  intellectual
        liberty because they have no intellect. In a Party  member,  on
        the  other  hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on
        the most unimportant subject can be tolerated.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7826"><span data-line="7826"></span>A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye  of
        the  Thought Police. Even when he is alone he can never be sure
        that he is alone. Wherever he may be, asleep or awake,  working
        or  resting, in his bath or in bed, he can be inspected without
        warning and without knowing that he is being inspected. Nothing
        that he does is indifferent. His friendships, his  relaxations,
        his  behaviour towards his wife and children, the expression of
        his face when he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep,  even
        the  characteristic  movements  of  his body, are all jealously
        scrutinized.  Not  only  any  actual  misdemeanour,   but   any
        eccentricity,  however small, any change of habits, any nervous
        mannerism that could  possibly  be  the  symptom  of  an  inner
        struggle,  is  certain  to  be  detected.  He has no freedom of
        choice in any direction whatever. On the other hand his actions
        are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated  code  of
        behaviour.  In  Oceania  there  is no law. Thoughts and actions
        which, when detected,  mean  certain  death  are  not  formally
        forbidden,   and   the   endless   purges,  arrests,  tortures,
        imprisonments,  and  vaporizations   are   not   inflicted   as
        punishment  for  crimes which have actually been committed, but
        are merely the wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a
        crime at some time in the future. A Party member is required to
        have not only the right opinions, but the right instincts. Many
        of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never  plainly
        stated,  and  could  not  be  stated  without  laying  bare the
        contradictions inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person  naturally
        orthodox  (in  Newspeak  a  goodthinker), he will in all
        circumstances know, without taking thought, what  is  the  true
        belief  or  the desirable emotion. But in any case an elaborate
        mental training, undergone in  childhood  and  grouping  itself
        round  the  Newspeak  words  crimestop,  blackwhite, and
        doublethink, makes him unwilling and unable to think too
        deeply on any subject whatever.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7860"><span data-line="7860"></span>A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and
        no respites from enthusiasm.  He  is  supposed  to  live  in  a
        continuous  frenzy  of  hatred  of foreign enemies and internal
        traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement before the
        power  and wisdom of the Party. The discontents produced by his
        bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately  turned  outwards  and
        dissipated  by  such  devices  as the Two Minutes Hate, and the
        speculations  which  might  possibly  induce  a  sceptical   or
        rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired
        inner   discipline.   The  first  and  simplest  stage  in  the
        discipline, which can be taught  even  to  young  children,  is
        called,  in  Newspeak,  crimestop.  Crimestop  means the
        faculty of stopping  short,  as  though  by  instinct,  at  the
        threshold  of  any  dangerous thought. It includes the power of
        not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical  errors,
        of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical
        to  Ingsoc,  and  of  being  bored  or repelled by any train of
        thought which is capable of leading in a  heretical  direction.
        Crimestop,  in  short,  means  protective stupidity. But
        stupidity is not enough. On the contrary, orthodoxy in the full
        sense demands a control over  one<span data-line="7880"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7880"></span>s  own  mental  processes  as
        complete  as  that  of  a  contortionist over his body. Oceanic
        society rests ultimately on the  belief  that  Big  Brother  is
        omnipotent  and  that  the  Party  is  infallible. But since in
        reality Big Brother is not omnipotent  and  the  party  is  not
        infallible,  there  is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment
        flexibility in the treatment of  facts.  The  keyword  here  is
        blackwhite.  Like  so many Newspeak words, this word has
        two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it
        means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white,  in
        contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it
        means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party
        discipline  demands  this.  But  it  means  also the ability to
        believe that black is white, and  more,  to  know
        that  black  is white, and to forget that one has ever believed
        the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past,
        made possible by the system of thought  which  really  embraces
        all   the   rest,   and   which   is   known   in  Newspeak  as
        doublethink.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7900"><span data-line="7900"></span>The alteration of the past is necessary for  two  reasons,
        one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The
        subsidiary   reason   is   that  the  Party  member,  like  the
        proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because he
        has no standards of comparison. He must be  cut  off  from  the
        past,  just  as  he  must  be  cut  off from foreign countries,
        because it is necessary for him to believe that  he  is  better
        off  than  his ancestors and that the average level of material
        comfort is constantly rising. But by  far  the  more  important
        reason  for  the  readjustment  of  the  past  is  the  need to
        safeguard the infallibility of the Party. It is not merely that
        speeches,  statistics,  and  records  of  every  kind  must  be
        constantly  brought  up  to  date  in  order  to  show that the
        predictions of the Party were in all cases right.  It  is  also
        that  no  change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever
        be admitted. For to change one<span data-line="7915"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7915"></span>s mind, or even one<span data-line="7915"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7915"></span>s policy, is
        a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasia or  Eastasia
        (whichever  it  may  be)  is the enemy today, then that country
        must always have been the enemy. And if the facts say otherwise
        then the facts must be altered. Thus  history  is  continuously
        rewritten.  This day-to-day falsification of the past, carried
        out by the Ministry of Truth, is as necessary to the  stability
        of  the regime as the work of repression and espionage carried
        out by the Ministry of Love.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7925"><span data-line="7925"></span>The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc.
        Past events, it is argued, have  no  objective  existence,  but
        survive only in written records and in human memories. The past
        is  whatever the records and the memories agree upon. And since
        the Party is in full control of all records and in equally full
        control of the minds of its members, it follows that  the  past
        is  whatever the Party chooses to make it. It also follows that
        though the past is alterable, it never has been altered in  any
        specific  instance.  For when it has been recreated in whatever
        shape is needed at the moment, then this new version  is
        the  past,  and  no  different past can ever have existed. This
        holds good even when, as often happens, the same event  has  to
        be  altered out of recognition several times in the course of a
        year. At all times the  Party  is  in  possession  of  absolute
        truth,  and  clearly the absolute can never have been different
        from what it is now. It will be seen that the  control  of  the
        past  depends above all on the training of memory. To make sure
        that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment
        is merely a  mechanical  act.  But  it  is  also  necessary  to
        remember that events happened in the desired manner. And
        if  it  is  necessary  to rearrange one<span data-line="7945"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7945"></span>s memories or to tamper
        with written records, then it  is  necessary  to  forget
        that  one  has  done so. The trick of doing this can be learned
        like any other mental technique. It is  learned  by  the
        majority  of  Party  members,  and  certainly  by  all  who are
        intelligent as well as orthodox.  In  Oldspeak  it  is  called,
        quite  frankly,  <span data-line="7951"></span>&#8216;_reality  control&#8217;<span data-line="7951"></span>.  In  Newspeak it is called
        doublethink, though  doublethink  comprises  much

<p class="p indent" data-line="7955"><span data-line="7955"></span>Doublethink   means   the   power  of  holding  two
        contradictory  beliefs  in  one<span data-line="7956"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7956"></span>s  mind   simultaneously,   and
        accepting  both  of them. The Party intellectual knows in which
        direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that
        he is playing tricks with  reality;  but  by  the  exercise  of
        doublethink  he  also  satisfies himself that reality is
        not violated. The process has to be conscious, or it would  not
        be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be
        unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and
        hence  of  guilt.  Doublethink lies at the very heart of
        Ingsoc, since  the  essential  act  of  the  Party  is  to  use
        conscious  deception  while  retaining  the firmness of purpose
        that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies  while
        genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become
        inconvenient,  and  then,  when  it becomes necessary again, to
        draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to
        deny the existence of objective reality and all  the  while  to
        take  account  of  the  reality which one denies — all this is
        indispensably   necessary.   Even    in    using    the    word
        doublethink     it     is    necessary    to    exercise
        doublethink. For by using the word one admits  that  one
        is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink
        one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie
        always  one  leap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by means
        of doublethink that the Party has been able — and  may,
        for  all we know, continue to be able for thousands of years —
        to arrest the course of history.

<p class="p indent" data-line="7983"><span data-line="7983"></span>All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because
        they ossified or because they grew  soft.  Either  they  became
        stupid  and  arrogant,  failed to adjust themselves to changing
        circumstances, and were overthrown; or they became liberal  and
        cowardly,  made  concessions  when they should have used force,
        and once again were overthrown. They  fell,  that  is  to  say,
        either  through consciousness or through unconsciousness. It is
        the achievement of the Party  to  have  produced  a  system  of
        thought  in which both conditions can exist simultaneously. And
        upon no other intellectual basis  could  the  dominion  of  the
        Party  be  made  permanent.  If one is to rule, and to continue
        ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality. For
        the secret of rulership is to combine a  belief  in  one<span data-line="7995"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7995"></span>s  own
        infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="7998"><span data-line="7998"></span>It  need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of
        doublethink are those  who  invented  doublethink
        and  know  that  it is a vast system of mental cheating. In our
        society, those who have the best knowledge of what is happening
        are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is.
        In general, the greater  the  understanding,  the  greater  the
        delusion;  the  more  intelligent,  the  less  sane.  One clear
        illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in
        intensity as  one  rises  in  the  social  scale.  Those  whose
        attitude  towards  the  war  is  most  nearly  rational are the
        subject peoples of the disputed territories.  To  these  people
        the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro
        over their bodies like a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a
        matter  of complete indifference to them. They are aware that a
        change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing the
        same work as before for new masters who treat them in the  same
        manner as the old ones. The slightly more favoured workers whom
        we  call  <span data-line="8015"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">the proles</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8015"></span> are only intermittently conscious of the
        war. When it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies  of
        fear  and  hatred, but when left to themselves they are capable
        of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening. It is
        in the ranks of the Party, and above all of  the  Inner  Party,
        that  the  true  war  enthusiasm  is  found.  World-conquest is
        believed in most firmly by those who know it to be  impossible.
        This  peculiar  linking-together of opposites — knowledge with
        ignorance,  cynicism  with  fanaticism-is  one  of  the   chief
        distinguishing  marks of Oceanic society. The official ideology
        abounds with contradictions even when  there  is  no  practical
        reason  for  them.  Thus,  the Party rejects and vilifies every
        principle for which the Socialist  movement  originally  stood,
        and it chooses to do this in the name of Socialism. It preaches
        a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past,
        and  it  dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time
        peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason.  It
        systematically  undermines the solidarity of the family, and it
        calls its leader by a name which is  a  direct  appeal  to  the
        sentiment  of  family  loyalty.  Even  the  names  of  the four
        Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence
        in their deliberate reversal of  the  facts.  The  Ministry  of
        Peace  concerns  itself  with  war,  the Ministry of Truth with
        lies, the Ministry of Love with torture  and  the  Ministry  of
        Plenty   with   starvation.   These   contradictions   are  not
        accidental, nor do they result from  ordinary  hypocrisy;  they
        are  deliberate exercises in doublethink. For it is only
        by  reconciling  contradictions  that  power  can  be  retained
        indefinitely.  In  no  other  way  could  the  ancient cycle be
        broken. If human equality is to be for ever averted —  if  the
        High,  as  we  have  called  them,  are  to  keep  their places
        permanently — then the prevailing  mental  condition  must  be
        controlled insanity.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8049"><span data-line="8049"></span>But  there is one question which until this moment we have
        almost ignored. It is;  why  should  human  equality  be
        averted?  Supposing that the mechanics of the process have been
        rightly described, what is the motive for this huge, accurately
        planned effort to freeze history  at  a  particular  moment  of
        time?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8056"><span data-line="8056"></span>Here  we  reach  the  central secret. As we have seen. the
        mystique of the Party,  and  above  all  of  the  Inner  Party,
        depends  upon doublethink. But deeper than this lies the
        original motive, the never-questioned instinct that  first  led
        to  the  seizure  of  power and brought doublethink, the
        Thought Police, continuous warfare, and all the other necessary
        paraphernalia into existence  afterwards.  This  motive  really
        consists … Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes
        aware of a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia had been very
        still for some time past. She was lying on her side, naked from
        the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed on her hand and  one
        dark  lock  tumbling  across her eyes. Her breast rose and fell
        slowly and regularly.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8070"><span data-line="8070"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8070"></span>_<span data-line="8070"></span>Julia.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8072"><span data-line="8072"></span>No answer.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8074"><span data-line="8074"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Julia, are you awake?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8074"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8076"><span data-line="8076"></span>No answer. She was  asleep.  He  shut  the  book,  put  it
        carefully  on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet over
        both of them.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8080"><span data-line="8080"></span>He had still,  he  reflected,  not  learned  the  ultimate
        secret.   He  understood  how;  he  did  not  understand
        why. Chapter I, like Chapter III, had not actually  told
        him  anything  that he did not know, it had merely systematized
        the knowledge that he possessed already. But after  reading  it
        he  knew  better  than  before  that he was not mad. Being in a
        minority, even a minority of one, did not make you  mad.  There
        was  truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth
        even against the whole world, you were not mad. A  yellow  beam
        from  the  sinking  sun  slanted in through the window and fell
        across the pillow. He shut his eyes. The sun on  his  face  and
        the  girl<span data-line="8091"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8091"></span>s  smooth  body  touching  his own gave him a strong,
        sleepy, confident feeling. He  was  safe,  everything  was  all
        right.  He  fell  asleep murmuring <span data-line="8093"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Sanity is not statistical,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8093"></span>
        with the feeling that this remark contained in  it  a  profound
        wisdom.  When he woke it was with the sensation of having slept
        for a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned  clock  told
        him that it was only twenty-thirty. He lay dozing for a while;
        then  the  usual  deep-lunged singing struck up from the yard
        below;

        and got out of bed.

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8120"><span data-line="8120"></span>Winston also got up and dressed himself. The indefatigable
        voice sang on:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="8123" style="display:block"><code>         &#39;_They sye that time &#39;_eals all things,

<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="8128"><span data-line="8128"></span>As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across
        to the  window.  The sun must have gone down behind the houses;
        it was not shining into the yard  any  longer.  The  flagstones
        were  wet  as  though they had just been washed, and he had the
        feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh and pale was
        the blue between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the woman marched
        to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and  falling
        silent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. He
        wondered whether she took in washing for a living or was merely
        the  slave  of  twenty  or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come
        across to his side; together they gazed down  with  a  sort  of
        fascination  at  the  sturdy  figure below. As he looked at the
        woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick  arms  reaching
        up  for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it
        struck him for the first time that she was  beautiful.  It  had
        never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty,
        blown   up   to  monstrous  dimensions  by  childbearing,  then
        hardened, roughened by work till it was  coarse  in  the  grain
        like  an  over-ripe  turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so,
        and after all, he thought,  why  not?  The  solid,  contourless
        body,  like  a block of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore
        the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to  the
        rose. Why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8152"><span data-line="8152"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">She&#39;s beautiful,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8152"></span> he murmured.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8154"><span data-line="8154"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">She&#39;s a metre across the hips, easily,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8154"></span> said Julia.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8156"><span data-line="8156"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That is her style of beauty,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8156"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8158"><span data-line="8158"></span>He  held Julia<span data-line="8158"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8158"></span>s supple waist easily encircled by his arm.
        From the hip to the knee her flank  was  against  his.  Out  of
        their  bodies  no child would ever come. That was the one thing
        they could never do. Only by word of mouth, from mind to  mind,
        could  they  pass  on  the  secret. The woman down there had no
        mind, she had only strong arms, a warm  heart,  and  a  fertile
        belly. He wondered how many children she had given birth to. It
        might easily be fifteen. She had had her momentary flowering, a
        year,  perhaps,  of  wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly
        swollen like a fertilized fruit and  grown  hard  and  red  and
        coarse,  and  then  her  life  had  been laundering, scrubbing,
        darning,  cooking,  sweeping,  polishing,  mending,  scrubbing,
        laundering,  first  for  children, then for grandchildren, over
        thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still  singing.
        The  mystical  reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed
        up with the aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching  away
        behind  the  chimney-pots  into  interminable  distance. It was
        curious to think that the sky was the same  for  everybody,  in
        Eurasia  or  Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the
        sky were also very much the same — everywhere,  all  over  the
        world,  hundreds  of  thousands of millions of people just like
        this, people ignorant of one another<span data-line="8179"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8179"></span>s existence, held apart by
        walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly  the  same  —
        people  who  had never learned to think but who were storing up
        in their hearts and bellies and muscles the  power  that  would
        one  day  overturn  the world. If there was hope, it lay in the
        proles! Without having read to the end of the book,  he
        knew  that  that  must be Goldstein<span data-line="8185"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8185"></span>s final message. The future
        belonged to the proles. And could he be sure  that  when  their
        time came the world they constructed would not be just as alien
        to  him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party? Yes, because
        at the least it would be a world  of  sanity.  Where  there  is
        equality  there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen,
        strength would  change  into  consciousness.  The  proles  were
        immortal,  you  could  not  doubt  it  when  you looked at that
        valiant figure in the yard. In the end  their  awakening  would
        come.  And  until  that happened, though it might be a thousand
        years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like  birds,
        passing  on  from body to body the vitality which the Party did
        not share and could not kill.

<p class="p indent" data-line="8205"><span data-line="8205"></span>The birds sang, the proles sang. the Party did  not  sing.
        All  round  the  world,  in  London and New York, in Africa and
        Brazil, and in  the  mysterious,  forbidden  lands  beyond  the
        frontiers,  in the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the villages
        of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and Japan
        — everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable  figure,  made
        monstrous by work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death
        and  still  singing.  Out  of  those  mighty  loins  a  race of
        conscious beings must one day come. You were the  dead,  theirs
        was  the future. But you could share in that future if you kept
        alive the mind as they kept alive the body, and passed  on  the
        secret doctrine that two plus two make four.

<p class="p indent" data-line="8224"><span data-line="8224"></span>They  sprang  apart.  Winston<span data-line="8224"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8224"></span>s  entrails  seemed  to have
        turned into ice. He could see the white all round the irises of
        Julia<span data-line="8226"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8226"></span>s eyes. Her face had turned a milky yellow. The smear  of
        rouge  that  was  still  on  each  cheekbone stood out sharply,
        almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.

        nothing except stand gazing into one another<span data-line="8238"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8238"></span>s eyes. To run for
        life, to get out of the house before it was too late — no such
        thought occurred to them. Unthinkable to disobey the iron voice
        from the wall. There was a snap as  though  a  catch  had  been
        turned  back,  and  a  crash of breaking glass. The picture had
        fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it.

<p class="p indent" data-line="8245"><span data-line="8245"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Now they can see us,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8245"></span> said Julia.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8247"><span data-line="8247"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"> Now we can see you,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8247"></span> said the voice. <span data-line="8247"></span><em class="em-low1">&#39; Stand out in  the
        middle of the room. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands behind
        your heads. Do not touch one another.</em><span data-line="8249"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8249"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8251"><span data-line="8251"></span>They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could
        feel Julia<span data-line="8252"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8252"></span>s body shaking. Or perhaps it was merely the shaking
        of his  own.  He could just stop his teeth from chattering, but
        his knees were  beyond  his  control.  There  was  a  sound  of
        trampling  boots  below, inside the house and outside. The yard
        seemed to be full of men. Something was  being  dragged  across
        the stones. The woman<span data-line="8257"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8257"></span>s singing had stopped abruptly. There was
        a  long,  rolling  clang,  as though the washtub had been flung
        across the yard, and then a confusion  of  angry  shouts  which
        ended in a yell of pain.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8262"><span data-line="8262"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The house is surrounded,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8262"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8264"><span data-line="8264"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The house is surrounded,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8264"></span> said the voice.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8266"><span data-line="8266"></span>He  heard Julia snap her teeth together. <span data-line="8266"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I suppose we may
        as well say good-bye,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8267"></span> she said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8269"><span data-line="8269"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You may as well say good-bye,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8269"></span> said the voice.  And  then
        another  quite  different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which
        Winston had the impression of having heard before,  struck  in;
        <span data-line="8272"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And  by  the  way,  while we are on the subject, &#8220;Here comes a
        candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper  to  chop  off
        your head&#8221;!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8274"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8276"><span data-line="8276"></span>Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston<span data-line="8276"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8276"></span>s back. The
        head of  a  ladder  had  been thrust through the window and had
        burst in the frame. Someone was climbing  through  the  window.
        There  was a stampede of boots up the stairs. The room was full
        of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots  on  their
        feet and truncheons in their hands.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8283"><span data-line="8283"></span>Winston  was  not  trembling  any longer. Even his eyes he
        barely moved. One thing alone mattered; to keep still, to  keep
        still  and  not  give  them an excuse to hit you! A man with a
        smooth prize-fighter<span data-line="8286"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8286"></span>s jowl in which the mouth was only a  slit
        paused   opposite  him  balancing  his  truncheon  meditatively
        between thumb and forefinger. Winston met his eyes. The feeling
        of nakedness, with one<span data-line="8289"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8289"></span>s hands behind one<span data-line="8289"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8289"></span>s head and one<span data-line="8289"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8289"></span>s face
        and body all exposed, was almost unbearable. The man  protruded
        the  tip  of  a  white  tongue, licked the place where his lips
        should have been, and then passed on. There was another  crash.
        Someone  had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and
        smashed it to pieces on the hearth-stone.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8296"><span data-line="8296"></span>The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar
        rosebud from a cake, rolled across the mat. How small,  thought
        Winston,  how small it always was! There was a gasp and a thump
        behind him, and he received a violent kick on the  ankle  which
        nearly  flung  him  off his balance. One of the men had smashed
        his fist into Julia<span data-line="8301"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8301"></span>s solar plexus,  doubling  her  up  like  a
        pocket  ruler.  She  was thrashing about on the floor, fighting
        for  breath.  Winston  dared  not  turn  his  head  even  by  a
        millimetre,  but  sometimes her livid, gasping face came within
        the angle of his vision. Even in his terror it was as though he
        could feel the pain in his own  body,  the  deadly  pain  which
        nevertheless  was less urgent than the struggle to get back her
        breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing  pain
        which  was  there  all the while but could not be suffered yet,
        because before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe.
        Then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and shoulders,  and
        carried  her out of the room like a sack. Winston had a glimpse
        of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with  the  eyes
        shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that
        was the last he saw of her.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8317"><span data-line="8317"></span>He  stood  dead  still.  No  one had hit him yet. Thoughts
        which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting
        began to flit through his mind. He wondered  whether  they  had
        got Mr Charrington. He wondered what they had done to the woman
        in  the  yard.  He noticed that he badly wanted to urinate, and
        felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or three
        hours ago. He noticed that the clock on  the  mantelpiece  said
        nine,  meaning  twenty-one.  But  the  light seemed too strong.
        Would not the light be fading at twenty-one hours on an  August
        evening?  He  wondered  whether  after  all  he  and  Julia had
        mistaken the time — had slept the clock round and  thought  it
        was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty on the
        following  morning.  But he did not pursue the thought further.
        It was not interesting.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8332"><span data-line="8332"></span>There  ws  another,  lighter  step  in  the  passage.   Mr
        Charrington  came  into  the  room. The demeanour of the 
        black-uniformed men suddenly became more subdued. Something had  also
        changed  in  Mr  Charrington<span data-line="8335"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8335"></span>s  appearance. His eye fell on the
        fragments of the glass paperweight.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8338"><span data-line="8338"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Pick up those pieces,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8338"></span> he said sharply.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8340"><span data-line="8340"></span>A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disappeared;
        Winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had  heard
        a  few  moments ago on the telescreen. Mr Charrington was still
        wearing his old velvet jacket, but his  hair,  which  had  been
        almost  white,  had  turned  black. Also he was not wearing his
        spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp  glance,  as  though
        verifying his identity, and then paid no more attention to him.
        He  was  still recognizable, but he was not the same person any
        longer. His body had straightened, and  seemed  to  have  grown
        bigger.  His  face  had  undergone  only  tiny changes that had
        nevertheless  worked  a  complete  transformation.  The   black
        eyebrows  were  less  bushy,  the wrinkles were gone, the whole
        lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose  seemed
        shorter.  It  was  the  alert,  cold  face  of  a  man of about
        five-and-thirty. It occurred to Winston that for the first time
        in his life he was looking, with knowledge, at a member of  the
        Thought Police.
</p><h2 id="sec--" class="h1" data-line="8358" data-heading-depth="1" style="display:block"><span data-line="8358"></span><span class="heading-before"><span class="heading-label">18</span>.&#8194;</span><span data-line="8358"></span> </h2>
<p class="p noindent" data-line="8360"><span data-line="8360"></span>He  did  not  know  where he was. Presumably he was in the
        Ministry of Love, but there was no way of  making  certain.  He
        was   in   a  high-ceilinged  windowless  cell  with  walls  of
        glittering white porcelain. Concealed  lamps  flooded  it  with
        cold  light, and there was a low, steady humming sound which he
        supposed had something to do with the air supply. A  bench,  or
        shelf,  just  wide  enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken
        only by the door and, at the end opposite the door, a  lavatory
        pan  with  no  wooden seat. There were four telescreens, one in
        each wall.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8371"><span data-line="8371"></span>There was a dull aching in his belly. It  had  been  there
        ever  since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven
        him away. But he was also hungry, with a  gnawing,  unwholesome
        kind  of  hunger.  It  might  be twenty-four hours since he had
        eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know,  probably
        never  would  know, whether it had been morning or evening when
        they arrested him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8379"><span data-line="8379"></span>He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with  his
        hands crossed on his knee. He had already learned to sit still.
        If  you  made  unexpected movements they yelled at you from the
        telescreen. But the craving for food was growing upon him. What
        he longed for above all was a piece of bread. He  had  an  idea
        that  there  were  a  few  breadcrumbs  in  the  pocket  of his
        overalls. It was even possible — he thought this because  from
        time  to  time something seemed to tickle his leg — that there
        might be a  sizeable  bit  of  crust  there.  In  the  end  the
        temptation  to  find  out  overcame his fear; he slipped a hand
        into his pocket.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8391"><span data-line="8391"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Smith!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8391"></span> yelled a voice from the telescreen.  <span data-line="8391"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">6079  Smith
        W.! Hands out of pockets in the cells!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8392"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8394"><span data-line="8394"></span>He  sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before
        being brought here he had been taken  to  another  place  which
        must  have  been an ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up used
        by the patrols. He did not know how long  he  had  been  there;
        some  hours  at any rate; with no clocks and no daylight it was
        hard to gauge the time. It was a  noisy,  evil-smelling  place.
        They  had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in,
        but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten  or  fifteen
        people.  The  majority of them were common criminals, but there
        were a few political prisoners among them. He  had  sat  silent
        against  the  wall, jostled by dirty bodies, too preoccupied by
        fear and the pain in his belly to take  much  interest  in  his
        surroundings,  but still noticing the astonishing difference in
        demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Party
        prisoners were always silent and terrified,  but  the  ordinary
        criminals  seemed  to  care  nothing  for  anybody. They yelled
        insults  at  the  guards,  fought  back  fiercely  when   their
        belongings  were  impounded,  wrote obscene words on the floor,
        ate  smuggled  food  which  they   produced   from   mysterious
        hiding-places  in  their  clothes,  and  even  shouted down the
        telescreen when it tried to restore order. On  the  other  hand
        some of them seemed to be on good terms with the guards, called
        them  by nicknames, and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the
        spyhole in the  door.  The  guards,  too,  treated  the  common
        criminals  with  a  certain  forbearance, even when they had to
        handle  them  roughly.  There   was   much   talk   about   the
        forced-labour  camps to which most of the prisoners expected to
        be sent. It was <span data-line="8421"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">all right</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8421"></span> in the camps, he gathered, so  long
        as you had good contacts and knew the ropes. There was bribery,
        favouritism,   and   racketeering  of  every  kind,  there  was
        homosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit  alcohol
        distilled from potatoes. The positions of trust were given only
        to  the  common  criminals,  especially  the  gangsters and the
        murderers, who formed a sort of aristocracy. All the dirty jobs
        were done by the politicals.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8430"><span data-line="8430"></span>There was a constant come-and-go  of  prisoners  of  every
        description: drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, 
        drunks, prostitutes. Some of  the  drunks  were  so violent<span data-line="8432"></span><br>
<span data-line="8433"></span>        that the  other  prisoners had to combine to suppress
        them. An enormous wreck of a  woman,  aged  about  sixty,  with
        great  tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had
        come down  in  her  struggles,  was  carried  in,  kicking  and
        shouting,  by  four  guards,  who  had  hold of her one at each
        corner. They wrenched off the boots with  which  she  had  been
        trying  to kick them, and dumped her down across Winston<span data-line="8439"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8439"></span>s lap,
        almost breaking his  thigh-bones.  The  woman  hoisted  herself
        upright  and  followed them out with a yell of <span data-line="8441"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">F— bastards!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8441"></span>
        Then, noticing that she was sitting on  something  uneven,  she
        slid off Winston<span data-line="8443"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8443"></span>s knees on to the bench.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8445"><span data-line="8445"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Beg pardon, dearie,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8445"></span> she said. <span data-line="8445"></span>&#8216;_I wouldn&#39;t &#8217;<span data-line="8445"></span>_<span data-line="8445"></span>a sat on you,
        only the  buggers  put me there. They dono <span data-line="8446"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">ow to treat a lady,
        do they?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8447"></span> She paused, patted her breast, and belched. <span data-line="8447"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Pardon,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8447"></span>
        she said, <span data-line="8448"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I ain&#39;t meself, quite.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8448"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8450"><span data-line="8450"></span>She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8452"><span data-line="8452"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Thass better,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8452"></span> she said, leaning back with  closed  eyes.
        <span data-line="8453"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Never  keep  it  down,  thass what I say. Get it up while it&#39;s
        fresh on your stomach, like.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8454"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8456"><span data-line="8456"></span>She revived, turned to have another look  at  Winston  and
        seemed  immediately  to take a fancy to him. She put a vast arm
        round his shoulder and drew him towards her, breathing beer and
        vomit into his face.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8461"><span data-line="8461"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Wass your name, dearie?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8461"></span> she said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8463"><span data-line="8463"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Smith,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8463"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8465"><span data-line="8465"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Smith?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8465"></span> said the woman. <span data-line="8465"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Thass  funny.  My  name&#39;s  Smith
        too. Why,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8466"></span> she added sentimentally, <span data-line="8466"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I might be your mother!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8466"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8468"><span data-line="8468"></span>She  might,  thought Winston, be his mother. She was about
        the right age and physique, and it  was  probable  that  people
        changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced-labour camp.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8472"><span data-line="8472"></span>No  one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent the
        ordinary criminals ignored the Party prisoners.  <span data-line="8473"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The  polits,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8473"></span>
        they  called  them,  with  a sort of uninterested contempt. The
        Party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking  to  anybody,  and
        above all of speaking to one another. Only once, when two Party
        members,  both women, were pressed close together on the bench,
        he overheard amid the din of voices a  few  hurriedly-whispered
        words;  and in particular a reference to something called <span data-line="8479"></span>&#8216;_room
        one-oh-one&#8217;<span data-line="8480"></span>, which he did not understand.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8482"><span data-line="8482"></span>It might be two or three hours ago that they  had  brought
        him  here.  The  dull  pain  in  his belly never went away, but
        sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse, and his  thoughts
        expanded  or  contracted  accordingly.  When  it  grew worse he
        thought only of the pain itself, and of his  desire  for  food.
        When it grew better, panic took hold of him. There were moments
        when  he  foresaw the things that would happen to him with such
        actuality that his heart galloped and his  breath  stopped.  He
        felt  the smash of truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots
        on his shins; he saw himself grovelling on the floor, screaming
        for mercy through broken teeth. He hardly thought of Julia.  He
        could  not  fix  his  mind  on  her. He loved her and would not
        betray her; but that was only a fact,  known  as  he  knew  the
        rules  of  arithmetic.  He  felt no love for her, and he hardly
        even wondered what was happening to her. He thought oftener  of
        O<span data-line="8497"></span>&#8216;Brien, with a flickering hope. O&#39;Brien might know that he had
        been  arrested.  The  Brotherhood,  he had said, never tried to
        save its members. But there was the  razor  blade;  they  would
        send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps five
        seconds  before  the  guard could rush into the cell. The blade
        would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness,  and  even
        the  fingers  that held it would be cut to the bone. Everything
        came back to his sick body, which  shrank  trembling  from  the
        smallest  pain.  He was not certain that he would use the razor
        blade even if he got the chance. It was more natural  to  exist
        from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes_&#8217;<span data-line="8507"></span> life even
        with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8510"><span data-line="8510"></span>Sometimes  he  tried  to calculate the number of porcelain
        bricks in the walls of the cell. It should have been easy,  but
        he  always  lost  count at some point or another. More often he
        wondered where he was, and what time of  day  it  was.  At  one
        moment  he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside, and
        at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In this
        place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be  turned
        out.  It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O<span data-line="8517"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8517"></span>Brien
        had seemed to recognize the allusion. In the Ministry  of  Love
        there  were  no  windows. His cell might be at the heart of the
        building or against its outer wall;  it  might  be  ten  floors
        below  ground,  or  thirty  above it. He moved himself mentally
        from place to place, and tried to determine by the  feeling  of
        his  body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep
        underground.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8526"><span data-line="8526"></span>There was a sound of marching  boots  outside.  The  steel
        door  opened  with  a  clang.  A  young  officer, a trim 
        black-uniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over  with  polished
        leather,  and whose pale, straight-featured face was like a wax
        mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned  to  the
        guards  outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The
        poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. The door  clanged  shut
        again.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8535"><span data-line="8535"></span>Ampleforth  made  one or two uncertain movements from side
        to side, as though having some idea that there was another door
        to go out of, and then began to wander up and down the cell. He
        had not yet noticed Winston<span data-line="8538"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8538"></span>s presence. His troubled eyes  were
        gazing  at  the wall about a metre above the level of Winston<span data-line="8539"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8539"></span>s
        head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes were sticking  out  of
        the  holes  in  his socks. He was also several days away from a
        shave. A scrubby beard covered  his  face  to  the  cheekbones,
        giving  him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large
        weak frame and nervous movements.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8546"><span data-line="8546"></span>Winston roused hirnself a little  from  his  lethargy.  He
        must   speak   to  Ampleforth,  and  risk  the  yell  from  the
        telescreen. It was even conceivable  that  Ampleforth  was  the
        bearer of the razor blade.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8551"><span data-line="8551"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Ampleforth,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8551"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8553"><span data-line="8553"></span>There  was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth paused,
        mildly startled. His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8556"><span data-line="8556"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Ah, Smith!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8556"></span> he said. <span data-line="8556"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You too!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8556"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8558"><span data-line="8558"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What are you in for?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8558"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8560"><span data-line="8560"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">To tell you the truth — </em>&#8217;<span data-line="8560"></span> He sat down awkwardly  on  the
        bench  opposite  Winston.  <span data-line="8561"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There is only one offence, is there
        not?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8562"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8564"><span data-line="8564"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And have you committed it?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8564"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8566"><span data-line="8566"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Apparently I have.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8566"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8568"><span data-line="8568"></span>He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples  for
        a moment, as though trying to remember something.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8571"><span data-line="8571"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">These things happen,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8571"></span> he began vaguely. <span data-line="8571"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I have been able
        to recall  one  instance  —  a  possible  instance.  It was an
        indiscretion,  undoubtedly.  We  were  producing  a  definitive
        edition  of  the  poems of Kipling. I allowed the word &#8220;God&#8221; to
        remain at the end of a line. I could not  help  it!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8575"></span>  he  added
        almost  indignantly,  raising  his face to look at Winston. <span data-line="8576"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It
        was impossible to change the line. The rhyme was &#8220;rod&#8221;. Do  you
        realize  that  there  are  only  twelve  rhymes to &#8220;rod&#8221; in the
        entire language?  For  days  I  had  racked  my  brains.  There
        was no other rhyme.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8580"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8582"><span data-line="8582"></span>The  expression  on his face changed. The annoyance passed
        out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased. A sort  of
        intellectual  warmth,  the  joy of the pedant who has found out
        some useless fact, shone through the dirt and scrubby hair.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8587"><span data-line="8587"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Has it ever occurred to you,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8587"></span> he said,  <span data-line="8587"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">that  the  whole
        history  of English poetry has been determined by the fact that
        the English language lacks rhymes?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8589"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8591"><span data-line="8591"></span>No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston.
        Nor, in the circumstances, did it strike him as very  important
        or interesting.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8595"><span data-line="8595"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do you know what time of day it is?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8595"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8597"><span data-line="8597"></span>Ampleforth  looked  startled  again. <span data-line="8597"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I had hardly thought
        about it. They arrested me — it  could  be  two  days  ago  —
        perhaps  three.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8599"></span> His eyes flitted round the walls, as though he
        half  expected  to  find  a  window  somewhere.  <span data-line="8600"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There  is  no
        difference  between  night  and day in this place. I do not see
        how one can calculate the time.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8602"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8604"><span data-line="8604"></span>They talked desultorily for some  minutes,  then,  without
        apparent  reason,  a  yell  from  the  telescreen  bade them be
        silent. Winston sat quietly, his hands crossed. Ampleforth, too
        large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench, fidgeted from side
        to side, clasping his lank hands first  round  one  knee,  then
        round  the  other.  The telescreen barked at him to keep still.
        Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour —  it  was  difficult  to
        judge.  Once more there was a sound of boots outside. Winston<span data-line="8611"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8611"></span>s
        entrails contracted. Soon, very soon, perhaps in five  minutes,
        perhaps  now,  the  tramp of boots would mean that his own turn
        had come.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8616"><span data-line="8616"></span>The door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped into
        the cell. With a  brief  movement  of  the  hand  he  indicated
        Ampleforth.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8620"><span data-line="8620"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Room 101,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8620"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8622"><span data-line="8622"></span>Ampleforth  marched  clumsily  out between the guards, his
        face vaguely perturbed, but uncomprehending.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8625"><span data-line="8625"></span>What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Winston<span data-line="8625"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8625"></span>s
        belly had revived. His mind sagged round and round on the  same
        trick, like a ball falling again and again into the same series
        of  slots.  He  had only six thoughts. The pain in his belly; a
        piece of bread; the blood and the screaming; O<span data-line="8629"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8629"></span>Brien  ;  Julia;
        the  razor  blade. There was another spasm in his entrails, the
        heavy boots were approaching. As the door opened, the  wave  of
        air  that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat.
        Parsons walked into the cell. He was wearing khaki shorts and a
        sports-shirt.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8636"><span data-line="8636"></span>This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8638"><span data-line="8638"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You here!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8638"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8640"><span data-line="8640"></span>Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there  was  neither
        interest  nor  surprise,  but  only  misery.  He  began walking
        jerkily up and down, evidently unable to keep still. Each  time
        he  straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that they were
        trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring look, as though he
        could not prevent himself  from  gazing  at  something  in  the
        middle distance.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8648"><span data-line="8648"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What are you in for?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8648"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8650"><span data-line="8650"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Thoughtcrime!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8650"></span>  said Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone
        of his voice implied at once a complete admission of his  guilt
        and  a  sort  of  incredulous  horror that such a word could be
        applied to  himself.  He  paused  opposite  Winston  and  began
        eagerly appealing to him: <span data-line="8654"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You don&#39;t think they&#39;ll shoot me, do
        you,  old  chap?  They  don&#39;t shoot you if you haven&#39;t actually
        done anything — only thoughts, which you can&#39;t  help?  I  know
        they  give  you  a  fair  hearing.  Oh,  I trust them for that!
        They&#39;ll know my record, won&#39;t they? You know what kind of  chap
        I  was.  Not  a  bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of course, but
        keen. I tried to do my best for the Party, didn&#39;t I?  I&#39;ll  get
        off with five years, don&#39;t you think? Or even ten years? A chap
        like me could make himself pretty useful in a labour-camp. They
        wouldn&#39;t shoot me for going off the rails just once?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8663"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8665"><span data-line="8665"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Are you guilty?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8665"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8667"><span data-line="8667"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Of  course  I&#39;m  guilty!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8667"></span>  cried Parsons with a servile
        glance at the telescreen. <span data-line="8668"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  don&#39;t  think  the  Party  would
        arrest  an  innocent  man,  do  you?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8669"></span>  His  frog-like face grew
        calmer, and even took on a slightly  sanctimonious  expression.
        <span data-line="8671"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Thoughtcrime   is   a   dreadful  thing,  old  man,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8671"></span>  he  said
        sententiously. <span data-line="8672"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s insidious. It can get hold of you  without
        your  even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my
        sleep! Yes, that&#39;s a fact. There I was, working away, trying to
        do my bit — never knew I had any bad stuff in my mind at  all.
        And  then  I started talking in my sleep. Do you know what they
        heard me saying?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8677"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8679"><span data-line="8679"></span>He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical
        reasons to utter an obscenity.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8682"><span data-line="8682"></span>&#8220;Down with Big Brother!&#8221;<span data-line="8682"></span> Yes, I said that!  Said  it  over
        and over again, it seems. Between you and me, old man, I<span data-line="8683"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8683"></span>m glad
        they  got  me  before it went any further. Do you know what I<span data-line="8684"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8684"></span>m
        going to say to them when I go up before the  tribunal?  <span data-line="8685"></span>&#8220;Thank
        you,&#8221;<span data-line="8686"></span>  I<span data-line="8686"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8686"></span>m going to say, <span data-line="8686"></span>&#8220;thank you for saving me before it was
        too late.&#8221;<span data-line="8687"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8689"><span data-line="8689"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Who denounced you?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8689"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8691"><span data-line="8691"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It was my little daughter,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8691"></span> said Parsons with a  sort  of
        doleful  pride.  <span data-line="8692"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I was
        saying, and nipped off to the patrols the very next day. Pretty
        smart for a nipper of seven, eh? I don&#39;t bear  her  any  grudge
        for  it. In fact I&#39;m proud of her. It shows I brought her up in
        the right spirit, anyway.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8696"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8698"><span data-line="8698"></span>He made a few more jerky movements up  and  down,  several
        times,  casting  a  longing glance at the lavatory pan. Then he
        suddenly ripped down his shorts.
             <span data-line="8701"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Excuse me, old man,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8701"></span> he said. <span data-line="8701"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I can&#39;t help it. It&#39;s  the
        waiting.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8702"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8704"><span data-line="8704"></span>He  plumped  his  large  posterior  into the lavatory pan.
        Winston covered his face with his hands.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8707"><span data-line="8707"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Smith!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8707"></span> yelled the voice from the telescreen. <span data-line="8707"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">6079 Smith
        W! Uncover your face. No faces covered in the cells.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8708"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8710"><span data-line="8710"></span>Winston uncovered his face.  Parsons  used  the  lavatory,
        loudly  and  abundantly.  It  then turned out that the plug was
        defective and the cell stank abominably for hours afterwards.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8714"><span data-line="8714"></span>Parsons  was  removed.  More  prisoners  came  and   went,
        mysteriously.  One,  a woman, was consigned to <span data-line="8715"></span>&#8216;_Room 101&#8217;<span data-line="8715"></span>, and,
        Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel and turn a different  colour
        when  she  heard  the  words.  A time came when, if it had been
        morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or  if
        it  had  been  afternoon, then it would be midnight. There were
        six prisoners in the cell, men and women. All sat  very  still.
        Opposite  Winston  there sat a man with a chinless, toothy face
        exactly like that of some  large,  harmless  rodent.  His  fat,
        mottled  cheeks  were  so  pouched  at  the  bottom that it was
        difficult not to believe that he  had  little  stores  of  food
        tucked  away  there. His pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from
        face to face and turned  quickly  away  again  when  he  caught
        anyone<span data-line="8727"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8727"></span>s eye.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8729"><span data-line="8729"></span>The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose
        appearance  sent  a  momentary  chill through Winston. He was a
        commonplace, mean-looking man who might have been  an  engineer
        or  technician  of  some  kind.  But what was startling was the
        emaciation of his face. It was like a  skull.  Because  of  its
        thinness  the  mouth  and eyes looked disproportionately large,
        and the eyes  seemed  filled  with  a  murderous,  unappeasable
        hatred of somebody or something.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8738"><span data-line="8738"></span>The  man  sat  down on the bench at a little distance from
        Winston. Winston did not look at him again, but the  tormented,
        skull-like  face was as vivid in his mind as though it had been
        straight in front of his eyes. Suddenly he  realized  what  was
        the  matter.  The man was dying of starvation. The same thought
        seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the  cell.
        There  was  a  very faint stirring all the way round the bench.
        The  eyes  of  the  chinless  man  kept  flitting  towards  the
        skull-faced man, then turning guiltily away, then being dragged
        back  by  an  irresistible  attraction.  Presently  he began to
        fidget on his seat. At  last  he  stood  up,  waddled  clumsily
        across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls, and,
        with  an  abashed  air,  held out a grimy piece of bread to the
        skull- faced man.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8753"><span data-line="8753"></span>There was a furious, deafening roar from  the  telescreen.
        The  chinless man jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man had
        quickly  thrust  his  hands  behind   his   back,   as   though
        demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8758"><span data-line="8758"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Bumstead!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8758"></span>  roared the voice. <span data-line="8758"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">2713 Bumstead J.! Let fall
        that piece of bread!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8759"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8761"><span data-line="8761"></span>The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8763"><span data-line="8763"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Remain standing where you are,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8763"></span> said the voice. <span data-line="8763"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Face the
        door. Make no movement.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8764"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8766"><span data-line="8766"></span>The chinless man obeyed.  His  large  pouchy  cheeks  were
        quivering  uncontrollably.  The door clanged open. As the young
        officer entered and stepped aside, there  emerged  from  behind
        him  a  short stumpy guard with enormous arms and shoulders. He
        took his stand opposite the chinless man, and then, at a signal
        from the officer, let free  a  frightful  blow,  with  all  the
        weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless man<span data-line="8772"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8772"></span>s mouth.
        The  force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor.
        His body was flung across the cell and fetched up  against  the
        base  of  the  lavatory  seat.  For  a  moment he lay as though
        stunned, with dark blood oozing from his mouth and nose. A very
        faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemed  unconscious,  came
        out  of  him. Then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily
        on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the  two
        halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8782"><span data-line="8782"></span>The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their
        knees.  The  chinless man climbed back into his place. Down one
        side of his face the flesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen
        into a shapeless cherry-coloured mass with a black hole in  the
        middle of it.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8788"><span data-line="8788"></span>From  time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast
        of his overalls. His grey eyes still flitted from face to face,
        more guiltily than ever, as though he were trying  to  discover
        how much the others despised him for his humiliation.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8793"><span data-line="8793"></span>The   door  opened.  With  a  small  gesture  the  officer
        indicated the skull-faced man.

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8798"><span data-line="8798"></span>There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston<span data-line="8798"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8798"></span>s side.  The  man
        had  actually flung himself on his knees on the floor, with his
        hand clasped together.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8802"><span data-line="8802"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Comrade! Officer!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8802"></span> he cried. <span data-line="8802"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You don&#39;t have to  take  me
        to that place! Haven&#39;t I told you everything already? What else
        is  it  you  want  to know? There&#39;s nothing I wouldn&#39;t confess,
        nothing! Just tell me what it is and I&#39;ll confess straight off.
        Write it down and I&#39;ll sign it — anything! Not room 101!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8806"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8808"><span data-line="8808"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Room 101,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8808"></span> said the officer.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8810"><span data-line="8810"></span>The man<span data-line="8810"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8810"></span>s face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston
        would  not  have  believed   possible.   It   was   definitely,
        unmistakably, a shade of green.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8814"><span data-line="8814"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do  anything  to me!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8814"></span> he yelled. <span data-line="8814"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You&#39;ve been starving me
        for weeks. Finish it off and let me die.  Shoot  me.  Hang  me.
        Sentence  me  to  twenty-five years. Is there somebody else you
        want me to give away? Just say who it  is  and  I&#39;ll  tell  you
        anything  you  want.  I  don&#39;t care who it is or what you do to
        them. I&#39;ve got a wife and three children. The biggest  of  them
        isn&#39;t six years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut
        their  throats in front of my eyes, and I&#39;ll stand by and watch
        it. But not Room 101!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8822"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8824"><span data-line="8824"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Room 101,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8824"></span> said the officer.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8826"><span data-line="8826"></span>The man looked frantically round at the  other  prisoners,
        as  though  with  some idea that he could put another victim in
        his own place. His eyes settled on  the  smashed  face  of  the
        chinless man. He flung out a lean arm.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8831"><span data-line="8831"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That&#39;s  the  one  you  ought  to  be  taking, not me!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8831"></span> he
        shouted. <span data-line="8832"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You didn&#39;t hear what he was saying after they  bashed
        his  face. Give me a chance and I&#39;ll tell you every word of it.
        He&#39;s the one that&#39;s against  the  Party,  not  me.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8834"></span>  The
        guards  stepped forward. The man<span data-line="8835"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8835"></span>s voice rose to a shriek. <span data-line="8835"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You
        didn&#39;t hear him!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8836"></span> he repeated. <span data-line="8836"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Something went wrong  with  the
        telescreen. He&#39;s the one you want. Take him, not me!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8837"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8839"><span data-line="8839"></span>The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms.
        But just  at  this  moment he flung himself across the floor of
        the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs  that  supported  the
        bench.  He  had  set up a wordless howling, like an animal. The
        guards took hold of him to wrench him loose, but  he  clung  on
        with astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty seconds they were
        hauling at him. The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed on
        their  knees,  looking  straight  in front of them. The howling
        stopped; the man had no breath left for anything except hanging
        on. Then there was a different kind  of  cry.  A  kick  from  a
        guard<span data-line="8849"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8849"></span>s  boot  had broken the fingers of one of his hands. They
        dragged him to his feet.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8852"><span data-line="8852"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Room 101,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8852"></span> said the officer.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8854"><span data-line="8854"></span>The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken,
        nursing his crushed hand, all the fight had gone out of him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8857"><span data-line="8857"></span>A long time passed. If  it  had  been  midnight  when  the
        skull-faced  man was taken away, it was morning: if morning, it
        was afternoon. Winston was alone, and had been alone for hours.
        The pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often  he
        got  up  and  walked  about,  unreproved by the telescreen. The
        piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it.
        At the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it, but
        presently hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was  sticky  and
        evil-tasting.  The  humming sound and the unvarying white light
        induced a sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his  head.
        He  would  get  up  because the ache in his bones was no longer
        bearable, and then would sit down again almost at once  because
        he  was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet. Whenever
        his physical sensations were a little under control the  terror
        returned.  Sometimes  with  a fading hope he thought of O<span data-line="8871"></span>&#8216;Brien
        and the razor blade. It was  thinkable  that  the  razor  blade
        might  arrive  concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More
        dimly he thought of Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering
        perhaps far worse than he. She might be screaming with pain  at
        this  moment. He thought: &#8217;<span data-line="8876"></span><em class="em-low1">If I could save Julia by doubling my
        own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would.</em><span data-line="8877"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8877"></span> But that was merely  an
        intellectual  decision,  taken because he knew that he ought to
        take it. He did not feel it. In this place you could  not  feel
        anything,  except  pain and foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was
        it possible, when you were actually suffering it, to  wish  for
        any  reason  that  your  own  pain  should  increase?  But that
        question was not answerable yet.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8885"><span data-line="8885"></span>The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O<span data-line="8885"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8885"></span>Brien
        came in.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8888"><span data-line="8888"></span>Winston started to his feet. The shock of  the  sight  had
        driven all caution out of him. For the first time in many years
        he forgot the presence of the telescreen.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8892"><span data-line="8892"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They&#39;ve got you too!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8892"></span> he cried.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8894"><span data-line="8894"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They  got  me a long time ago,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8894"></span> said O<span data-line="8894"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8894"></span>Brien with a mild,
        almost regretful irony. He stepped aside. from behind him there
        emerged a broad-chested guard with a long  black  truncheon  in
        his hand.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8899"><span data-line="8899"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  know  him,  Winston,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8899"></span>  said  O<span data-line="8899"></span>&#8216;Brien. &#8217;<span data-line="8899"></span><em class="em-low1">Don&#39;t deceive
        yourself. You did know it — you have always known it.</em><span data-line="8900"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8900"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8902"><span data-line="8902"></span>Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was  no
        time to think of that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in
        the  guard<span data-line="8904"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8904"></span>s hand. It might fall anywhere; on the crown, on the
        tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow-
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8907"><span data-line="8907"></span>The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost  paralysed,
        clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand. Everything had
        exploded  into  yellow light. Inconceivable, inconceivable that
        one blow could cause such pain! The light cleared and he  could
        see  the  other two looking down at him. The guard was laughing
        at his contortions. One question  at  any  rate  was  answered.
        Never,  for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase
        of pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it  should
        stop.  Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the
        face of pain there are no heroes, no heroes,  he  thought  over
        and over as he writhed on the floor, clutching uselessly at his
        disabled left arm.
</p><h2 id="sec--" class="h1" data-line="8920" data-heading-depth="1" style="display:block"><span data-line="8920"></span><span class="heading-before"><span class="heading-label">19</span>.&#8194;</span><span data-line="8920"></span> </h2>
<p class="p noindent" data-line="8922"><span data-line="8922"></span>He  was  lying  on  something  that  felt like a camp bed,
        except that it was higher off the ground and that he was  fixed
        down  in  some way so that he could not move. Light that seemed
        stronger than usual  was  falling  on  his  face.  O<span data-line="8925"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8925"></span>Brien  was
        standing  at  his  side,  looking  down at him intently. At the
        other side of him stood a  man  in  a  white  coat,  holding  a
        hypodermic syringe.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8930"><span data-line="8930"></span>Even  after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings
        only gradually. He had the impression of swimming up into  this
        room  from  some  quite  different  world, a sort of underwater
        world far beneath it. How long he had been down  there  he  did
        not  know.  Since  the moment when they arrested him he had not
        seen darkness or  daylight.  Besides,  his  memories  were  not
        continuous.  There  had been times when consciousness, even the
        sort of consciousness that one has in sleep, had  stopped  dead
        and  started  again  after  a  blank  interval. But whether the
        intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds, there  was  no
        way of knowing.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8942"><span data-line="8942"></span>With  that  first  blow  on  the  elbow  the nightmare had
        started. Later he was to realize that all  that  then  happened
        was  merely  a  preliminary,  a  routine interrogation to which
        nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a long range  of
        crimes  —  espionage,  sabotage,  and  the  like  —  to which
        everyone had to confess as a matter of course.  The  confession
        was a formality, though the torture was real. How many times he
        had  been beaten, how long the beatings had continued, he could
        not remember. Always there  were  five  or  six  men  in  black
        uniforms   at  him  simultaneously.  Sometimes  it  was  fists,
        sometimes it was  truncheons,  sometimes  it  was  steel  rods,
        sometimes  it  was boots. There were times when he rolled about
        the floor, as shameless as an animal, writhing  his  body  this
        way and that in an endless, hopeless effort to dodge the kicks,
        and  simply  inviting  more and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in
        his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his  groin,  in  his
        testicles,  on  the  bone  at the base of his spine. There were
        times  when  it  went  on  and  on  until  the  cruel,  wicked,
        unforgivable  thing seemed to him not that the guards continued
        to beat him but that he could not force  hirnself  into  losing
        consciousness.  There  were times when his nerve so forsook him
        that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began,
        when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was  enough
        to  make  him  pour  forth  a  confession of real and imaginary
        crimes. There were other times when he  started  out  with  the
        resolve of confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced
        out  of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he
        feebly tried to compromise, when he said to  himself:  <span data-line="8969"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  will
        confess,  but  not  yet.  I must hold out till the pain becomes
        unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then  I  will
        tell  them  what  they  want.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="8972"></span>  Sometimes he was beaten till he
        could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of  potatoes  on  to
        the  stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate for a few hours,
        and then taken out and beaten again.  There  were  also  longer
        periods  of  recovery.  He  remembered them dimly, because they
        were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor.  He  remembered  a  cell
        with  a  plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall,
        and a tin wash-basin, and meals  of  hot  soup  and  bread  and
        sometimes  coffee.  He  remembered  a  surly barber arriving to
        scrape  his  chin  and  crop  his   hair,   and   businesslike,
        unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping his
        reflexes,  turning  up  his eyelids, running harsh fingers over
        him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles  into  his
        arm to make him sleep.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="8987"><span data-line="8987"></span>The  beatings  grew  less  frequent,  and  became mainly a
        threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at  any  moment
        when  his answers were unsatisfactory. His questioners now were
        not ruffians in black uniforms but Party intellectuals,  little
        rotund  men  with  quick movements and flashing spectacles, who
        worked on him  in  relays  over  periods  which  lasted  —  he
        thought,  he  could  not  be  sure  — ten or twelve hours at a
        stretch. These other questioners saw  to  it  that  he  was  in
        constant  slight  pain,  but  it was not chiefly pain that they
        relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his  ears.  pulled  his
        hair,  made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate,
        shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water;
        but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his
        power of arguing and  reasoning.  Their  real  weapon  was  the
        merciless  questioning  that  went  on and on, hour after hour,
        tripping him up, laying traps for him, twisting everything that
        he  said,  convicting  him  at   every   step   of   lies   and
        self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as
        from nervous fatigue Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times
        in  a  single  session. Most of the time they screamed abuse at
        him and threatened at every hesitation to deliver him  over  to
        the  guards  again;  but  sometimes  they would suddenly change
        their tune, call him comrade, appeal to  him  in  the  name  of
        Ingsoc  and  Big  Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even
        now he had not enough loyalty to the Party  left  to  make  him
        wish to undo the evil he had done. When his nerves were in rags
        after  hours  of questioning, even this appeal could reduce him
        to snivelling tears. In the end the nagging  voices  broke  him
        down more completely than the boots and fists of the guards. He
        became  simply  a  mouth  that  uttered,  a  hand  that signed,
        whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to find  out
        what  they  wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly,
        before  the  bullying  started  anew.  He  confessed   to   the
        assassination  of  eminent  Party  members, the distribution of
        seditious pamphlets, embezzlement  of  public  funds,  sale  of
        military  secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed that he
        had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian  government  as  far
        back as 1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an
        admirer  of capitalism, and a sexual pervert. He confessed that
        he had murdered his wife, although he knew, and his questioners
        must have known, that his wife was still  alive.  He  confessed
        that for years he had been in personal touch with Goldstein and
        had  been  a  member  of  an underground organization which had
        included almost every human being he had  ever  known.  It  was
        easier  to confess everything and implicate everybody. Besides,
        in a sense it was all true. It was true that he  had  been  the
        enemy  of  the Party, and in the eyes of the Party there was no
        distinction between the thought and the deed.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9036"><span data-line="9036"></span>There were also memories of another kind. They  stood  out
        in  his  mind  disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all
        round them.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9040"><span data-line="9040"></span>He was in a cell which might  have  been  either  dark  or
        light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near
        at  hand  some  kind  of  instrument  was  ticking  slowly  and
        regularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous. Suddenly  he
        floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed
        up.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9047"><span data-line="9047"></span>He  was  strapped  into a chair surrounded by dials, under
        dazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading  the  dials.
        There  was  a  tramp  of  heavy boots outside. The door clanged
        open. The waxed-faced  officer  marched  in,  followed  by  two
        guards.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9053"><span data-line="9053"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Room 101,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9053"></span> said the officer.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9055"><span data-line="9055"></span>The  man  in the white coat did not turn round. He did not
        look at Winston either; he was looking only at the dials.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9058"><span data-line="9058"></span>He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a  kilometre  wide,
        full  of  glorious,  golden  light,  roaring  with laughter and
        shouting out confessions at  the  top  of  his  voice.  He  was
        confessing  everything,  even  the  things  he had succeeded in
        holding back under the torture.  He  was  relating  the  entire
        history  of  his  life to an audience who knew it already. With
        him were the guards, the other questioners, the  men  in  white
        coats,  O<span data-line="9065"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9065"></span>Brien,  Julia,  Mr  Charrington, all rolling down the
        corridor together and shouting  with  laughter.  Some  dreadful
        thing  which  had  lain embedded in the future had somehow been
        skipped over and had not happened. Everything  was  all  right,
        there  was  no  more pain, the last detail of his life was laid
        bare, understood, forgiven.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9072"><span data-line="9072"></span>He was starting  up  from  the  plank  bed  in  the<span data-line="9072"></span><br>
<span data-line="9073"></span>        half-certainty that he had heard O<span data-line="9073"></span>&#8216;Brien&#39;s voice. All through his
        interrogation, although he had never seen him, he had  had  the
        feeling  that  O&#39;Brien  was at his elbow, just out of sight. It
        was O&#39;Brien who was directing everything. It was he who set the
        guards on to Winston and who prevented them from  killing  him.
        It  was  he  who  decided when Winston should scream with pain,
        when he should have a respite, when he should be fed,  when  he
        should  sleep, when the drugs should be pumped into his arm. It
        was he who asked the questions and suggested  the  answers.  He
        was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was the inquisitor,
        he  was  the  friend.  And  once  — Winston could not remember
        whether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in
        a moment of wakefulness — a voice murmured in his ear:  &#8217;<span data-line="9085"></span><em class="em-low1">Don&#39;t
        worry,  Winston;  you are in my keeping. For seven years I have
        watched over you. Now the turning-point has come. I shall  save
        you,  I shall make you perfect.</em><span data-line="9088"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9088"></span> He was not sure whether it was
        O<span data-line="9089"></span>&#8216;Brien&#39;s voice; but it was the same voice  that  had  said  to
        him,  &#8217;<span data-line="9090"></span><em class="em-low1">We  shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,</em><span data-line="9090"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9090"></span>
        in that other dream, seven years ago.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9093"><span data-line="9093"></span>He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There
        was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room, in  which
        he  now was had gradually materialized round him. He was almost
        flat on his back, and unable to move. His body was held down at
        every essential point. Even the back of his head was gripped in
        some manner. O<span data-line="9098"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9098"></span>Brien was looking down at him gravely and rather
        sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn,  with
        pouches  under  the  eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He
        was  older  than  Winston  had  thought  him;  he  was  perhaps
        forty-eight  or  fifty.  Under his hand there was a dial with a
        lever on top and figures running round the face.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9105"><span data-line="9105"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I told you,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9105"></span> said O<span data-line="9105"></span>&#8216;Brien, &#8217;<span data-line="9105"></span><em class="em-low1">that if we met again it would
        be here.</em><span data-line="9106"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9106"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9108"><span data-line="9108"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9108"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9110"><span data-line="9110"></span>Without any warning except a slight movement of  O<span data-line="9110"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9110"></span>Brien<span data-line="9110"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9110"></span>s
        hand,  a  wave  of  pain flooded his body. It was a frightening
        pain, because he could not see what was happening, and  he  had
        the  feeling  that some mortal injury was being done to him. He
        did not know whether the thing was really happening, or whether
        the effect was electrically produced; but his body  was  being
        wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart.
        Although  the  pain  had brought the sweat out on his forehead,
        the worst of all was the fear that his backbone  was  about  to
        snap.  He  set  his  teeth  and breathed hard through his nose,
        trying to keep silent as long as possible.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9122"><span data-line="9122"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You are afraid,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9122"></span> said O<span data-line="9122"></span>&#8216;Brien, watching his  face,  &#8217;<span data-line="9122"></span><em class="em-low1">that
        in  another  moment  something is going to break. Your especial
        fear is that it will be your backbone. You have a vivid  mental
        picture  of  the  vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid
        dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking, is it not,
        Winston?</em><span data-line="9127"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9127"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9129"><span data-line="9129"></span>Winston did not answer. O<span data-line="9129"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9129"></span>Brien drew back the lever on the
        dial. The wave of pain receded almost  as  quickly  as  it  had
        come.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9133"><span data-line="9133"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That  was  forty,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9133"></span>  said  O<span data-line="9133"></span>&#8216;Brien.  &#8217;<span data-line="9133"></span><em class="em-low1">You can see that the
        numbers on this dial run up  to  a  hundred.  Will  you  please
        remember,  throughout  our  conversation,  that I have it in my
        power to inflict pain on you at  any  moment  and  to  whatever
        degree  I  choose?  If  you  tell  me  any  lies, or attempt to
        prevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level  of
        intelligence,  you  will  cry  out with pain, instantly. Do you
        understand that?</em><span data-line="9140"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9140"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9142"><span data-line="9142"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9142"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9144"><span data-line="9144"></span>O<span data-line="9144"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9144"></span>Brien<span data-line="9144"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9144"></span>s manner became  less  severe.  He  resettled  his
        spectacles  thoughtfully,  and  took a pace or two up and down.
        When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. He had the  air
        of  a  doctor, a teacher, even a priest, anxious to explain and
        persuade rather than to punish.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9150"><span data-line="9150"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I am taking trouble with you, Winston,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9150"></span> he said, <span data-line="9150"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">because
        you are worth trouble. You know  perfectly  well  what  is  the
        matter  with  you. You have known it for years, though you have
        fought against the knowledge. You are  mentally  deranged.  You
        suffer from a defective memory. You are unable to remember real
        events and you persuade yourself that you remember other events
        which never happened. Fortunately it is curable. You have never
        cured  yourself of it, because you did not choose to. There was
        a small effort of the will that you were  not  ready  to  make.
        Even  now,  I  am  well aware, you are clinging to your disease
        under the impression that it is a virtue. Now we will  take  an
        example. At this moment, which power is Oceania at war with?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9161"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9163"><span data-line="9163"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9163"></span>_<span data-line="9163"></span>When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9165"><span data-line="9165"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">With  Eastasia.  Good. And Oceania has always been at war
        with Eastasia, has it not?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9166"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9168"><span data-line="9168"></span>Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth  to  speak
        and  then  did  not speak. He could not take his eyes away from
        the dial.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9172"><span data-line="9172"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The truth, please, Winston. Your  truth.  Tell  me
        what you think you remember.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9173"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9175"><span data-line="9175"></span>&#8216;_I  remember that until only a week before I was arrested,
        we were not at war with Eastasia at all. We  were  in  alliance
        with  them.  The  war  was against Eurasia. That had lasted for
        four years. Before that — &#8217;<span data-line="9178"></span>_<span data-line="9178"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9180"><span data-line="9180"></span>O<span data-line="9180"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9180"></span>Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9182"><span data-line="9182"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Another example,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9182"></span> he said. <span data-line="9182"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Some years ago you had a very
        serious delusion indeed. You believed  that  three  men,  three
        one-time Party members named Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford men
        who  were  executed for treachery and sabotage after making the
        fullest possible confession — were not guilty  of  the  crimes
        they  were  charged  with.  You  believed  that  you  had  seen
        unmistakable   documentary   evidence   proving   that    their
        confessions  were  false.  There was a certain photograph about
        which you had  a  hallucination.  You  believed  that  you  had
        actually  held  it in your hands. It was a photograph something
        like this.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9192"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9194"><span data-line="9194"></span>An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O<span data-line="9194"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9194"></span>Brien<span data-line="9194"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9194"></span>s
        fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within  the  angle  of
        Winston<span data-line="9196"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9196"></span>s  vision.  It  was  a  photograph,  and  there  was no
        question of its identity. It was the photograph. It  was
        another   copy  of  the  photograph  of  Jones,  Aaronson,  and
        Rutherford at the party function in  New  York,  which  he  had
        chanced  upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only
        an instant it was before his eyes, then it  was  out  of  sight
        again.  But  he  had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it! He
        made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench the  top  half  of
        his  body  free.  It  was  impossible  to  move  so  much  as a
        centimetre in  any  direction.  For  the  moment  he  had  even
        forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in
        his fingers again, or at least to see it.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9209"><span data-line="9209"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It exists!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9209"></span> he cried.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9211"><span data-line="9211"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9211"></span> said O<span data-line="9211"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9211"></span>Brien.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9213"><span data-line="9213"></span>He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the
        opposite  wall.  O<span data-line="9214"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9214"></span>Brien  lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail
        slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air;  it
        was vanishing in a flash of flame. O<span data-line="9216"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9216"></span>Brien turned away from the
        wall.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9219"><span data-line="9219"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Ashes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9219"></span>  he  said. <span data-line="9219"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It
        does not exist. It never existed.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9220"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9222"><span data-line="9222"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in  memory.  I
        remember it. You remember it.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9223"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9225"><span data-line="9225"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I do not remember it,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9225"></span> said O<span data-line="9225"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9225"></span>Brien.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9227"><span data-line="9227"></span>Winston<span data-line="9227"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9227"></span>s  heart  sank.  That  was  doublethink.  He had a
        feeling of deadly helplessness. If he could have  been  certain
        that O<span data-line="9229"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9229"></span>Brien was lying, it would not have seemed to matter. But
        it was perfectly possible that O<span data-line="9230"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9230"></span>Brien had really forgotten the
        photograph. And if so, then already he would have forgotten his
        denial  of remembering it, and forgotten the act of forgetting.
        How could one be sure that it was simple trickery? Perhaps that
        lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen:  that  was
        the thought that defeated him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9237"><span data-line="9237"></span>O<span data-line="9237"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9237"></span>Brien  was  looking down at him speculatively. More than
        ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains  with  a  wayward
        but promising child.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9241"><span data-line="9241"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There  is  a Party slogan dealing with the control of the
        past,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9242"></span> he said. <span data-line="9242"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Repeat it, if you please.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9242"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9244"><span data-line="9244"></span>&#8220;Who controls the past controls the future:  who  controls
        the present controls the past,&#8221;<span data-line="9245"></span> repeated Winston obediently.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9247"><span data-line="9247"></span>&#8220;Who   controls  the  present  controls  the  past,&#8221;<span data-line="9247"></span>  said
        O<span data-line="9248"></span>&#8216;Brien, nodding his head  with  slow  approval.  &#8217;<span data-line="9248"></span><em class="em-low1">Is  it  your
        opinion, Winston, that the past has real existence?</em><span data-line="9249"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9249"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9251"><span data-line="9251"></span>Again  the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston.
        His eyes flitted towards the dial. He not  only  did  not  know
        whether  <span data-line="9253"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">yes</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9253"></span>  or <span data-line="9253"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">no</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9253"></span> was the answer that would save him from
        pain; he did not even know which answer he believed to  be  the
        true one.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9257"><span data-line="9257"></span>O<span data-line="9257"></span>&#8216;Brien   smiled   faintly.  &#8217;<span data-line="9257"></span><em class="em-low1">You  are  no  metaphysician,
        Winston,</em><span data-line="9258"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9258"></span> he said. <span data-line="9258"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Until this moment you had never  considered
        what  is meant by existence. I will put it more precisely. Does
        the past exist concretely, in  space?  Is  there  somewhere  or
        other  a  place,  a  world  of solid objects, where the past is
        still happening?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9262"></span>

<p class="p indent" data-line="9264"><span data-line="9264"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9264"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9266"><span data-line="9266"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Then where does the past exist, if at all?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9266"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9268"><span data-line="9268"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">In records. It is written down.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9268"></span>

<p class="p indent" data-line="9270"><span data-line="9270"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">In records. And- ?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9270"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9272"><span data-line="9272"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9272"></span>_<span data-line="9272"></span>In the mind. In human memories.

        records, and we control all memories. Then we control the past,
        do we not?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9276"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9278"><span data-line="9278"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But  how  can  you stop people remembering things?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9278"></span> cried
        Winston  again  momentarily  forgetting  the   dial.   <span data-line="9279"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It   is
        involuntary. It is outside oneself. How can you control memory?
        You have not controlled mine!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9281"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9283"><span data-line="9283"></span>O<span data-line="9283"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9283"></span>Brien<span data-line="9283"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9283"></span>s manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on the
        dial.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9286"><span data-line="9286"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">On   the   contrary,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9286"></span>   he  said,  <span data-line="9286"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">you  have  not
        controlled it. That is what has brought you here. You are  here
        because  you  have failed in humility, in self-discipline. You
        would not make the act of submission  which  is  the  price  of
        sanity.  You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only
        the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that
        reality is something objective, external, existing in  its  own
        right.   You  also  believe  that  the  nature  of  reality  is
        self-evident. When you delude yourself into thinking  that  you
        see  something,  you  assume  that  everyone else sees the same
        thing as you. But I tell you,  Winston,  that  reality  is  not
        external.  Reality  exists in the human mind, and nowhere else.
        Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any
        case soon perishes: only in the mind of  the  Party,  which  is
        collective  and  immortal.  Whatever  the Party holds to be the
        truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality  except
        by looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that
        you  have  got  to  relearn,  Winston. It needs an act of 
        self-destruction, an effort of the will. You  must  humble  yourself
        before you can become sane.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9305"></span>

<p class="p indent" data-line="9307"><span data-line="9307"></span>He  paused  for  a few moments, as though to allow what he
        had been saying to sink in.

<p class="p indent" data-line="9315"><span data-line="9315"></span>O<span data-line="9315"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9315"></span>Brien  held  up his left hand, its back towards Winston,
        with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9318"><span data-line="9318"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9318"></span>_<span data-line="9318"></span>How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?

<p class="p indent" data-line="9322"><span data-line="9322"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And if the party says that it is not  four  but  five  —

<p class="p indent" data-line="9325"><span data-line="9325"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Four.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9325"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9327"><span data-line="9327"></span>The  word  ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial
        had shot up to fifty-five. The sweat had sprung  out  all  over
        Winston<span data-line="9329"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9329"></span>s body. The air tore into his lungs and issued again in
        deep  groans  which  even  by  clenching his teeth he could not
        stop. O<span data-line="9331"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9331"></span>Brien watched him, the four fingers still extended.  He
        drew  back  the  lever.  This  time  the pain was only slightly
        eased.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9335"><span data-line="9335"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">How many fingers, Winston?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9335"></span>

<p class="p indent" data-line="9339"><span data-line="9339"></span>The needle went up to sixty.

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9345"><span data-line="9345"></span>The needle must have risen again, but he did not  look  at
        it.  The  heavy,  stern  face  and  the four fingers filled his
        vision. The fingers stood up  before  his  eyes  like  pillars,
        enormous,  blurry,  and  seeming  to  vibrate, but unmistakably
        four.

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9365"><span data-line="9365"></span>Abruptly he was sitting up with O<span data-line="9365"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9365"></span>Brien<span data-line="9365"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9365"></span>s  arm  round  his
        shoulders. He had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds.
        The  bonds  that  had held his body down were loosened. He felt
        very cold,  he  was  shaking  uncontrollably,  his  teeth  were
        chattering,  the  tears  were  rolling  down  his cheeks. For a
        moment he clung to O<span data-line="9370"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9370"></span>Brien like a baby, curiously comforted  by
        the  heavy  arm  round  his  shoulders. He had the feeling that
        O<span data-line="9372"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9372"></span>Brien was his protector, that the  pain  was  something  that
        came  from  outside,  from  some  other source, and that it was
        O<span data-line="9374"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9374"></span>Brien who would save him from it.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9376"><span data-line="9376"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You are a slow learner, Winston,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9376"></span> said O<span data-line="9376"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9376"></span>Brien gently.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9378"><span data-line="9378"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">How can I help it?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9378"></span> he blubbered. <span data-line="9378"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9378"></span>_<span data-line="9378"></span>How can I help  seeing
        what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9381"><span data-line="9381"></span>Sometimes,  Winston.  Sometimes  they  are five. Sometimes
        they are three. Sometimes they are all of  them  at  once.  You
        must try harder. It is not easy to become sane.<span data-line="9383"></span>_<span data-line="9383"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9383"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9385"><span data-line="9385"></span>He  laid  Winston  down  on the bed. The grip of his limbs
        tightened again, but the pain had ebbed away and the  trembling
        had stopped, leaving him merely weak and cold. O<span data-line="9387"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9387"></span>Brien motioned
        with  his  head  to  the  man  in the white coat, who had stood
        immobile throughout the proceedings. The man in the white  coat
        bent  down  and  looked  closely  into Winston<span data-line="9390"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9390"></span>s eyes, felt his
        pulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped  here  and  there,
        then he nodded to O<span data-line="9392"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9392"></span>Brien.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9394"><span data-line="9394"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Again,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9394"></span> said O<span data-line="9394"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9394"></span>Brien.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9396"><span data-line="9396"></span>The pain flowed into Winston<span data-line="9396"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9396"></span>s body. The needle must be at
        seventy,  seventy-five. He had shut his eyes this time. He knew
        that the fingers were still there, and  still  four.  All  that
        mattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm was over. He
        had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not. The pain
        lessened  again. He opened his eyes. O<span data-line="9401"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9401"></span>Brien had drawn back the
        lever.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9404"><span data-line="9404"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">How many fingers, Winston?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9404"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9406"><span data-line="9406"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Four. I suppose there are four. I would  see  five  if  I
        could. I am trying to see five.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9407"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9409"><span data-line="9409"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Which  do  you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or
        really to see them?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9410"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9412"><span data-line="9412"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Really to see them.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9412"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9414"><span data-line="9414"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Again,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9414"></span> said O<span data-line="9414"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9414"></span>Brien.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9416"><span data-line="9416"></span>Perhaps the needle was eighty — ninety. Winston could not
        intermittently remember why the pain was happening. Behind  his
        screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a
        sort  of  dance,  weaving  in  and out, disappearing behind one
        another and reappearing again. He was trying to count them,  he
        could  not remember why. He knew only that it was impossible to
        count them, and that this was somehow  due  to  the  mysterious
        identity  between five and four. The pain died down again. When
        he opened his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing  the
        same  thing. Innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still
        streaming past in either direction, crossing and recrossing. He
        shut his eyes again.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9429"><span data-line="9429"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9429"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9431"><span data-line="9431"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. You will kill me  if  you  do
        that again. Four, five, six — in all honesty I don&#39;t know.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9432"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9434"><span data-line="9434"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Better,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9434"></span> said O<span data-line="9434"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9434"></span>Brien.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9436"><span data-line="9436"></span>A  needle  slid  into  Winston<span data-line="9436"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9436"></span>s  arm.  Almost in the same
        instant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through his body.
        The pain was already half-forgotten. He  opened  his  eyes  and
        looked  up  gratefully at O<span data-line="9439"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9439"></span>Brien. At sight of the heavy, lined
        face, so ugly and so intelligent,  his  heart  seemed  to  turn
        over. If he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand
        and laid it on O<span data-line="9442"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9442"></span>Brien arm. He had never loved him so deeply as
        at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain.
        The  old  feeling,  that  it  bottom  it did not matter whether
        O<span data-line="9445"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9445"></span>Brien was a friend or an enemy, had come back. O<span data-line="9445"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9445"></span>Brien was  a
        person  who  could be talked to. Perhaps one did not want to be
        loved so much as to be understood. O<span data-line="9447"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9447"></span>Brien had tortured him  to
        the  edge  of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain, he
        would send him to his death. It made  no  difference.  In  some
        sense  that  went  deeper than friendship, they were intimates:
        somewhere or other, although the actual words  might  never  be
        spoken,  there  was  a  place  where  they could meet and talk.
        O<span data-line="9453"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9453"></span>Brien was looking  down  at  him  with  an  expression  which
        suggested  that the same thought might be in his own mind. When
        he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9457"><span data-line="9457"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do you know where you are, Winston?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9457"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9459"><span data-line="9459"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I don&#39;t know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9459"></span>

<p class="p indent" data-line="9461"><span data-line="9461"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do you know how long you have been here?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9461"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9463"><span data-line="9463"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I don&#39;t know. Days,  weeks,  months  —  I  think  it  is
        months.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9464"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9466"><span data-line="9466"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And  why  do  you  imagine  that  we bring people to this
        place?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9467"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9469"><span data-line="9469"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">To make them confess.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9469"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9471"><span data-line="9471"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No, that is not the reason. Try again.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9471"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9473"><span data-line="9473"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">To punish them.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9473"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9475"><span data-line="9475"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9475"></span>   exclaimed   O<span data-line="9475"></span>&#8216;Brien.   His   voice   had   changed
        extraordinarily,  and  his  face had suddenly become both stern
        and animated. &#8217;<span data-line="9477"></span><em class="em-low1">No! Not merely to extract your  confession,  not
        to  punish  you. Shall I tell you why we have brought you here?
        To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand,  Winston,
        that  no  one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands
        uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that  you
        have  committed.  The Party is not interested in the overt act:
        the thought is all we care about. We do not merely destroy  our
        enemies,  we  change  them.  Do  you  understand what I mean by
        that?</em><span data-line="9485"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9485"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9487"><span data-line="9487"></span>He was bending over  Winston.  His  face  looked  enormous
        because of its nearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen
        from below. Moreover it was filled with a sort of exaltation, a
        lunatic intensity. Again Winston<span data-line="9490"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9490"></span>s heart shrank. If it had been
        possible  he  would  have  cowered deeper into the bed. He felt
        certain that O<span data-line="9492"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9492"></span>Brien was about to twist the dial out  of  sheer
        wantonness.  At  this  moment, however, O<span data-line="9493"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9493"></span>Brien turned away. He
        took a pace  or  two  up  and  down.  Then  he  continued  less
        vehemently:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9497"><span data-line="9497"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The  first  thing  for  you to understand is that in this
        place there are no martyrdoms. You have read of  the  religious
        persecutions  of  the  past.  In  the Middle Ages there was the
        Inquisitlon. It was a failure. It set out to eradicate  heresy,
        and  ended  by  perpetuating it. For every heretic it burned at
        the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was  that?  Because
        the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them
        while  they  were  still  unrepentant:  in fact, it killed them
        because they were unrepentant.  Men  were  dying  because  they
        would  not  abandon their true beliefs. Naturally all the glory
        belonged to the victim and all the shame to the Inquisitor  who
        burned  him.  Later,  in  the twentieth century, there were the
        totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazis
        and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more
        cruelly than the Inquisition had done. And they  imagined  that
        they  had  learned from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at
        any rate, that one must not make martyrs. Before  they  exposed
        their victims to public trial, they deliberately set themselves
        to  destroy  their  dignity. They wore them down by torture and
        solitude  until  they  were  despicable,   cringing   wretches,
        confessing   whatever  was  put  into  their  mouths,  covering
        themselves with  abuse,  accusing  and  sheltering  behind  one
        another,  whimpering  for mercy. And yet after only a few years
        the same thing had happened over again. The dead men had become
        martyrs and their degradation was forgotten.  Once  again,  why
        was  it?  In the first place, because the confessions that they
        had made were obviously extorted and untrue.  We  do  not  make
        mistakes  of  that  kind.  All the confessions that are uttered
        here are true. We make them true. And above all we do not allow
        the dead to rise up against us. You must  stop  imagining  that
        posterity  will  vindicate  you,  Winston. Posterity will never
        hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from  the  stream  of
        history.  We  shall  turn  you  into  gas and pour you into the
        stratosphere. Nothing will remain of  you,  not  a  name  in  a
        register,  not  a  memory  in  a  living  brain.  You  will  be
        annihilated in the past as well as  in  the  future.  You  will
        never have existed.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9533"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9535"><span data-line="9535"></span>Then  why  bother  to  torture me? thought Winston, with a
        momentary  bitterness.  O<span data-line="9536"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9536"></span>Brien  checked  his  step  as  though
        Winston had uttered the thought aloud. His large ugly face came
        nearer, with the eyes a little narrowed.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9540"><span data-line="9540"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  are  thinking,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9540"></span>  he  said,  <span data-line="9540"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">that since we intend to
        destroy you utterly, so that nothing that you  say  or  do  can
        make  the  smallest difference — in that case, why do we go to
        the trouble of interrogating you first? That is what  you  were
        thinking, was it not?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9544"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9546"><span data-line="9546"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9546"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9548"><span data-line="9548"></span>O<span data-line="9548"></span>&#8216;Brien  smiled  slightly. &#8217;<span data-line="9548"></span><em class="em-low1">You are a flaw in the pattern,
        Winston. You are a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell
        you just now that we are different from the persecutors of  the
        past? We are not content with negative obedience, nor even with
        the  most  abject submission. When finally you surrender to us,
        it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy the heretic
        because he resists us: so  long  as  he  resists  us  we  never
        destroy  him.  We  convert  him,  we capture his inner mind, we
        reshape him. We burn all evil and all illusion out of  him;  we
        bring  him  over to our side, not in appearance, but genuinely,
        heart and soul. We make him one of  ourselves  before  we  kill
        him.  It  is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should
        exist anywhere in the world, however secret  and  powerless  it
        may  be.  Even  in  the  instant  of death we cannot permit any
        deviation. In the old days the  heretic  walked  to  the  stake
        still  a  heretic, proclaiming his heresy, exulting in it. Even
        the victim of the Russian purges could carry  rebellion  locked
        up  in  his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the
        bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we  blow  it  out.
        The  command  of  the  old despotisms was &#8220;Thou shalt not&#8221;. The
        command of the totalitarians was &#8220;Thou shalt&#8221;. Our  command  is
        &#8220;Thou  art&#8221;.  No  one  whom  we bring to this place ever
        stands out against us. Everyone is  washed  clean.  Even  those
        three  miserable  traitors in whose innocence you once believed
        — Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford — in the end we broke  them
        down.  I  took  part  in their interrogation myself. I saw them
        gradually worn down, whimpering, grovelling, weeping — and  in
        the  end  it was not with pain or fear, only with penitence. By
        the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of
        men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they
        had done, and love of Big Brother. It was touching to  see  how
        they  loved  him.  They begged to be shot quickly, so that they
        could die while their minds were still clean.</em><span data-line="9580"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9580"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9582"><span data-line="9582"></span>His voice had grown almost  dreamy.  The  exaltation,  the
        lunatic   enthusiasm,   was  still  in  his  face.  He  is  not
        pretending, thought Winston, he is not a hypocrite, he believes
        every  word  he  says.  What  most  oppressed   him   was   the
        consciousness  of  his own intellectual inferiority. He watched
        the heavy yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of
        the range of his vision. O<span data-line="9588"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9588"></span>Brien was a being in all ways larger
        than himself. There was no idea that he had ever had, or  could
        have,  that  O<span data-line="9590"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9590"></span>Brien  had  not  long  ago  known, examined, and
        rejected. His mind contained Winston<span data-line="9591"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9591"></span>s mind. But in that
        case how could it be true that O<span data-line="9592"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9592"></span>Brien was mad? It must be  he,
        Winston,  who  was  mad. O<span data-line="9593"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9593"></span>Brien halted and looked down at him.
        His voice had grown stern again.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9596"><span data-line="9596"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do not imagine that  you  will  save  yourself,  Winston,
        however  completely  you  surrender  to us. No one who has once
        gone astray is ever spared. And even if we  chose  to  let  you
        live  out  the natural term of your life, still you would never
        escape  from  us.  What  happens  to  you  here  is  for  ever.
        Understand  that  in  advance.  We  shall crush you down to the
        point from which there is no coming back. Things will happen to
        you from which you could not recover, if you lived  a  thousand
        years.  Never  again  will  you  be  capable  of ordinary human
        feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never  again  will
        you  be  capable  of  love, or friendship, or joy of living, or
        laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You  will  be
        hollow.  We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you
        with ourselves.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9609"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9611"><span data-line="9611"></span>He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. Winston
        was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus  being  pushed  into
        place  behind his head. O<span data-line="9613"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9613"></span>Brien had sat down beside the bed, so
        that his face was almost on a level with Winston<span data-line="9614"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9614"></span>s.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9616"><span data-line="9616"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Three thousand,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9616"></span> he said, speaking over Winston<span data-line="9616"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9616"></span>s head to
        the man in the white coat.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9619"><span data-line="9619"></span>Two  soft  pads,  which  felt  slightly   moist,   clamped
        themselves  against  Winston<span data-line="9620"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9620"></span>s  temples.  He quailed. There was
        pain  coming,  a  new  kind  of  pain.  O<span data-line="9621"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9621"></span>Brien  laid  a   hand
        reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9624"><span data-line="9624"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">This  time  it  will  not hurt,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9624"></span> he said. <span data-line="9624"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Keep your eyes
        fixed on mine.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9625"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9627"><span data-line="9627"></span>At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or  what
        seemed  like  an  explosion,  though it was not certain whether
        there was any noise. There was undoubtedly a blinding flash  of
        light.  Winston  was not hurt, only prostrated. Although he had
        already been lying on his back when the thing happened, he  had
        a  curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position.
        A terrific painless blow had flattened him out. Also  something
        had  happened inside his head. As his eyes regained their focus
        he remembered who he was, and where he was, and recognized  the
        face that was gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there
        was  a  large  patch  of  emptiness, as though a piece had been
        taken out of his brain.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9640"><span data-line="9640"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It will not last,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9640"></span> said O<span data-line="9640"></span>&#8216;Brien. &#8217;<span data-line="9640"></span><em class="em-low1">Look me  in  the  eyes.
        What country is Oceania at war with?</em><span data-line="9641"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9641"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9643"><span data-line="9643"></span>Winston  thought.  He  knew  what was meant by Oceania and
        that he himself was a citizen of Oceania.  He  also  remembered
        Eurasia  and  Eastasia; but who was at war with whom he did not
        know. In fact he had not been aware that there was any war.

<p class="p indent" data-line="9650"><span data-line="9650"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oceania is at war with Eastasia.  Do  you  remember  that

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9655"><span data-line="9655"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oceania  has  always been at war with Eastasia. Since the
        beginning of your life, since the beginning of the Party, since
        the beginning of history,  the  war  has  continued  without  a
        break, always the same war. Do you remember that?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9658"></span>

<p class="p indent" data-line="9660"><span data-line="9660"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9660"></span>

<p class="p indent" data-line="9662"><span data-line="9662"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">  Eleven  years  ago you created a legend about three men
        who had been condemned to death for  treachery.  You  pretended
        that  you had seen a piece of paper which proved them innocent.
        No such piece of paper ever existed. You invented it, and later
        you grew to believe in it. You remember now the very moment  at
        which you first invented it. Do you remember that?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9667"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9669"><span data-line="9669"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9669"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9671"><span data-line="9671"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Just now I held up the fingers of my hand to you. You saw
        five fingers. Do you remember that?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9672"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9674"><span data-line="9674"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9674"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9676"><span data-line="9676"></span>O<span data-line="9676"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9676"></span>Brien  held  up  the  fingers of his left hand, with the
        thumb concealed.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9679"><span data-line="9679"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">There are five fingers there. Do you see five fingers?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9679"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9681"><span data-line="9681"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9681"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9683"><span data-line="9683"></span>And he did see them, for a fleeting  instant,  before  the
        scenery of his mind changed. He saw five fingers, and there was
        no  deformity.  Then  everything  was normal again, and the old
        fear, the hatred,  and  the  bewilderment  came  crowding  back
        again. But there had been a moment — he did not know how long,
        thirty seconds, perhaps — of luminous certainty, when each new
        suggestion  of O<span data-line="9689"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9689"></span>Brien<span data-line="9689"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9689"></span>s had filled up a patch of emptiness and
        become absolute truth, and when two and  two  could  have  been
        three  as  easily as five, if that were what was needed. It had
        faded but before O<span data-line="9692"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9692"></span>Brien had dropped his hand;  but  though  he
        could  not recapture it, he could remember it, as one remembers
        a vivid experience at some period of one<span data-line="9694"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9694"></span>s life when one was in
        effect a different person.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9697"><span data-line="9697"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You see now,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9697"></span> said O<span data-line="9697"></span>&#8216;Brien,  &#8217;<span data-line="9697"></span><em class="em-low1">that  it  is  at  any  rate
        possible.</em><span data-line="9698"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9698"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9700"><span data-line="9700"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9700"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9702"><span data-line="9702"></span>O<span data-line="9702"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9702"></span>Brien  stood  up  with a satisfied air. Over to his left
        Winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw
        back the plunger of a syringe. O<span data-line="9704"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9704"></span>Brien turned to Winston with a
        smile. In almost the old manner he resettled his spectacles  on
        his nose.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9708"><span data-line="9708"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do you remember writing in your diary,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9708"></span> he said, <span data-line="9708"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">that it
        did not  matter whether I was a friend or an enemy, since I was
        at least a person who understood you and could  be  talked  to?
        You  were  right.  I enjoy talking to you. Your mind appeals to
        me. It resembles my own mind  except  that  you  happen  to  be
        insane.  Before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a
        few questions, if you choose.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9714"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9716"><span data-line="9716"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Any question I like?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9716"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9718"><span data-line="9718"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Anything.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9718"></span> He saw that Winston<span data-line="9718"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9718"></span>s eyes were upon the dial.
        <span data-line="9719"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It is switched off. What is your first question?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9719"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9721"><span data-line="9721"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What have you done with Julia?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9721"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9723"><span data-line="9723"></span>O<span data-line="9723"></span>&#8216;Brien  smiled  again.  &#8217;<span data-line="9723"></span><em class="em-low1">She   betrayed   you,   Winston.
        Immediately-unreservedly.  I  have seldom seen anyone come over
        to us so promptly. You would hardly recognize her  if  you  saw
        her.  All  her  rebelliousness,  her  deceit,  her  folly,  her
        dirty-mindedness — everything has been burned out of  her.  It
        was a perfect conversion, a textbook case.</em><span data-line="9728"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9728"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9730"><span data-line="9730"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You tortured her?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9730"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9732"><span data-line="9732"></span>O<span data-line="9732"></span>&#8216;Brien left this unanswered. &#8217;<span data-line="9732"></span><em class="em-low1">Next question,</em><span data-line="9732"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9732"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9734"><span data-line="9734"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Does Big Brother exist?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9734"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9736"><span data-line="9736"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the
        embodiment of the Party.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9737"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9739"><span data-line="9739"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9739"></span>_<span data-line="9739"></span>Does he exist in the same way as I exist?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9741"><span data-line="9741"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You do not exist,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9741"></span> said O<span data-line="9741"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9741"></span>Brien.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9743"><span data-line="9743"></span>Once  again  the  sense  of  helplessness assailed him. He
        knew, or he could imagine, the arguments which proved  his  own
        nonexistence;  but they were nonsense, they were only a play on
        words. Did not the statement, <span data-line="9746"></span>&#8216;_You do  not  exist&#8217;<span data-line="9746"></span>,  contain  a
        logical  absurdity?  But  what  use  was it to say so? His mind
        shrivelled as he thought of  the  unanswerable,  mad  arguments
        with which O<span data-line="9749"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9749"></span>Brien would demolish him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9751"><span data-line="9751"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  think I exist,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9751"></span> he said wearily. <span data-line="9751"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I am conscious of my
        own identity. I was born and I shall die. I have arms and legs.
        I occupy a particular point in space. No other solid object can
        occupy the same point simultaneously. In that sense,  does  Big
        Brother exist?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9755"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9757"><span data-line="9757"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It is of no importance. He exists.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9757"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9759"><span data-line="9759"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Will Big Brother ever die?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9759"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9761"><span data-line="9761"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Of course not. How could he die? Next question.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9761"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9763"><span data-line="9763"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Does the Brotherhood exist?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9763"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9765"><span data-line="9765"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That,  Winston,  you will never know. If we choose to set
        you free when we have finished with you, and if you live to  be
        ninety years old, still you will never learn whether the answer
        to  that  question is Yes or No. As long as you live it will be
        an unsolved riddle in your mind.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9769"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9771"><span data-line="9771"></span>Winston lay silent. His breast  rose  and  fell  a  little
        faster.  He still had not asked the question that had come into
        his mind the first. He had got to ask it, and  yet  it  was  as
        though  his  tongue  would  not  utter it. There was a trace of
        amusement in O<span data-line="9775"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9775"></span>Brien<span data-line="9775"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9775"></span>s face. Even his spectacles seemed to wear
        an ironical gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly, he knows
        what I am going to ask! At the thought the words burst  out  of
        him:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9780"><span data-line="9780"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What is in Room 101?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9780"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9782"><span data-line="9782"></span>The  expression  on  O<span data-line="9782"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9782"></span>Brien<span data-line="9782"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9782"></span>s  face  did  not  change. He
        answered drily:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9785"><span data-line="9785"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You know what is in Room  101,  Winston.  Everyone  knows

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9788"><span data-line="9788"></span>He raised a finger to the man in the white coat. Evidently
        the session  was at an end. A needle jerked into Winston<span data-line="9789"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9789"></span>s arm.
        He sank almost instantly into deep sleep.

        O<span data-line="9795"></span>&#8216;Brien.  &#8217;<span data-line="9795"></span><em class="em-low1">There is learning, there is understanding, and there
        is acceptance. It is time for you  to  enter  upon  the  second
        stage.</em><span data-line="9797"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9797"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9799"><span data-line="9799"></span>As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late
        his bonds  were  looser. They still held him to the bed, but he
        could move his knees a little and could turn his head from side
        to side and raise his arms from the elbow. The dial, also,  had
        grown  to  be  less of a terror. He could evade its pangs if he
        was  quick-witted  enough:  it  was  chiefly  when  he   showed
        stupidity  that  O<span data-line="9805"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9805"></span>Brien  pulled  the lever. Sometimes they got
        through a whole session without use of the dial. He  could  not
        remember  how  many  sessions there had been. The whole process
        seemed to stretch out over a long, indefinite  time  —  weeks,
        possibly  —  and  the  intervals  between  the  sessions might
        sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9812"><span data-line="9812"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">As you lie there,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9812"></span> said O<span data-line="9812"></span>&#8216;Brien, &#8217;<span data-line="9812"></span><em class="em-low1">you have often wondered
        you have even asked me —  why  the  Ministry  of  Love  should
        expend  so much time and trouble on you. And when you were free
        you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question. You
        could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived in, but  not
        its  underlying motives. Do you remember writing in your diary,
        &#8220;I understand how: I do not understand why&#8221;? It was when
        you thought about &#8220;why&#8221; that you doubted your own  sanity.  You
        have read the book, Goldstein&#39;s book, or parts of it, at
        least. Did it tell you anything that you did not know already?</em><span data-line="9821"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9821"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9823"><span data-line="9823"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You have read it?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9823"></span> said Winston.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9825"><span data-line="9825"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it.
        No book is produced individually, as you know.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9826"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9828"><span data-line="9828"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Is it true, what it says?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9828"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9830"><span data-line="9830"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">A  description,  yes.  The  programme  it  sets  forth is
        nonsense. The secret accumulation of  knowledge  —  a  gradual
        spread  of  enlightenment — ultimately a proletarian rebellion
        — the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourself  that  that
        was  what  it  would  say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians
        will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a  million.  They
        cannot.  I  do  not  have  to  tell you the reason: you know it
        already. If you have  ever  cherished  any  dreams  of  violent
        insurrection,  you  must abandon them. There is no way in which
        the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is for ever.
        Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9840"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9842"><span data-line="9842"></span>He came closer to the bed. <span data-line="9842"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">For ever!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9842"></span> he  repeated.  <span data-line="9842"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And
        now  let  us  get  back to the question of &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221;. You
        understand well enough how the Party maintains itself in
        power. Now tell me why we cling to power. What is  our  motive?
        Why  should  we  want power? Go on, speak,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9846"></span> he added as Winston
        remained silent.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9849"><span data-line="9849"></span>Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another  moment  or
        two. A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad
        gleam  of enthusiasm had come back into O<span data-line="9851"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9851"></span>Brien<span data-line="9851"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9851"></span>s face. He knew
        in advance what O<span data-line="9852"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9852"></span>Brien would say. That the Party did not  seek
        power  for its own ends, but only for the good of the majority.
        That it sought  power  because  men  in  the  mass  were  frail
        cowardly  creatures  who  could  not endure liberty or face the
        truth, and must be ruled over and  systematically  deceived  by
        others  who  were stronger than themselves. That the choice for
        mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and  that,  for  the
        great bulk of mankind, happiness was better. That the party was
        the  eternal  guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil
        that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that  of
        others. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing
        was  that when O<span data-line="9863"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9863"></span>Brien said this he would believe it. You could
        see it in his face. O<span data-line="9864"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9864"></span>Brien knew everything. A  thousand  times
        better  than Winston he knew what the world was really like, in
        what degradation the mass of human beings  lived  and  by  what
        lies  and  barbarities  the  Party  kept  them  there.  He  had
        understood it all, weighed it all, and it made  no  difference:
        all  was  justified  by  the ultimate purpose. What can you do,
        thought Winston, against the lunatic who  is  more  intelligent
        than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then
        simply persists in his lunacy?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9874"><span data-line="9874"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You are ruling over us for our own good,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9874"></span> he said feebly.
        <span data-line="9875"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You believe   that   human   beings  are  not  fit  to  govern
        themselves, and therefore-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9876"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9878"><span data-line="9878"></span>He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain  had  shot
        through  his  body. O<span data-line="9879"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9879"></span>Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up
        to thirty-five.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9882"><span data-line="9882"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That was stupid, Winston, stupid!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9882"></span> he said.  <span data-line="9882"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  should
        know better than to say a thing like that.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9883"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9885"><span data-line="9885"></span>He pulled the lever back and continued:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9887"><span data-line="9887"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Now  I  will  tell  you  the answer to my question. It is
        this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake.  We  are
        not interested in the good of others ; we are interested solely
        in  power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only
        power, pure power. What pure power means  you  will  understand
        presently.  We  are  different  from all the oligarchies of the
        past, in that we know what we are doing. All the  others,  even
        those  who  resembled  ourselves, were- cowards and hypocrites.
        The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close  to
        us  in  their  methods,  but  they  never  had  the  courage to
        recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they  even
        believed,  that  they  had  seized  power unwillingly and for a
        limited time, and that  just  round  the  corner  there  lay  a
        paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not
        like  that.  We  know  that  no  one ever seizes power with the
        intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it  is  an
        end.  One  does  not  establish  a  dictatorship  in  order  to
        safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution  in  order  to
        establish  the  dictatorship.  The  object  of  persecution  is
        persecution. The object of torture is torture.  The  object  of
        power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9907"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9909"><span data-line="9909"></span>Winston  was  struck, as he had been struck before, by the
        tiredness of O<span data-line="9910"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9910"></span>Brien<span data-line="9910"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9910"></span>s face.  It  was  strong  and  fleshy  and
        brutal,  it  was  full of intelligence and a sort of controlled
        passion before which he  felt  himself  helpless;  but  it  was
        tired.  There were pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from
        the cheekbones. O<span data-line="9914"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9914"></span>Brien leaned over him, deliberately  bringing
        the worn face nearer.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9917"><span data-line="9917"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  are  thinking,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9917"></span>  he  said,  <span data-line="9917"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">that my face is old and
        tired. You are thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am  not
        even  able  to  prevent  the  decay of my own body. Can you not
        understand, Winston, that the individual is only  a  cell?  The
        weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism. Do you die
        when you cut your fingernails?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9922"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9924"><span data-line="9924"></span>He  turned  away  from  the bed and began strolling up and
        down again, one hand in his pocket.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9927"><span data-line="9927"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We are the priests of power,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9927"></span> he said. <span data-line="9927"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">God is power. But
        at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned. It
        is time for you to gather some idea of what  power  means.  The
        first  thing  you must realize is that power is collective. The
        individual only has power in so far  as  he  ceases  to  be  an
        individual.  You  know  the Party slogan: &#8220;Freedom is Slavery&#8221;.
        Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible?  Slavery  is
        freedom.  Alone  — free — the human being is always defeated.
        It must be so, because every human  being  is  doomed  to  die,
        which  is  the  greatest  of  all  failures. But if he can make
        complete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity,
        if he can merge himself in the Party so that he  is  the
        Party,  then  he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing
        for you to realize is that power is power  over  human  beings.
        Over  the body but, above all, over the mind. Power over matter
        — external reality, as you would call it — is not  important.
        Already our control over matter is absolute.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9943"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9945"><span data-line="9945"></span>For  a  moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a violent
        effort to raise himself into a  sitting  position,  and  merely
        succeeded in wrenching his body painfully.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9949"><span data-line="9949"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But how can you control matter?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9949"></span> he burst out. <span data-line="9949"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You don&#39;t
        even control  the  climate or the law of gravity. And there are
        disease, pain, death-</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9951"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9953"><span data-line="9953"></span>O<span data-line="9953"></span>&#8216;Brien silenced him  by  a  movement  of  his  hand.  &#8217;<span data-line="9953"></span><em class="em-low1">We
        control  matter  because we control the mind. Reality is inside
        the skull. You will learn by degrees, Winston. There is nothing
        that we could not do. Invisibility, levitation —  anything.  I
        could  float  off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to. I
        do not wish to, because the Party does not wish  it.  You  must
        get  rid  of  those  nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of
        Nature. We make the laws of Nature.</em><span data-line="9960"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9960"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9962"><span data-line="9962"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But you do not! You are not even masters of this  planet.
        What  about  Eurasia  and Eastasia? You have not conquered them
        yet.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9964"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9966"><span data-line="9966"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us.  And
        if  we did not, what difference would it make? We can shut them
        out of existence. Oceania is the world.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9968"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9970"><span data-line="9970"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man  is
        tiny  helpless! How long has he been in existence? For millions
        of years the earth was uninhabited.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9972"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9974"><span data-line="9974"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are,  no  older.  How
        could   it  be  older?  Nothing  exists  except  through  human
        consciousness.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9976"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9978"><span data-line="9978"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals —
        mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which  lived  here
        long before man was ever heard of.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9980"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9982"><span data-line="9982"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Have  you  ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not.
        Nineteenth-century biologists invented them. Before  man  there
        was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end, there would
        be nothing. Outside man there is nothing.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9985"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9987"><span data-line="9987"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars!
        Some of  them  are  a million light-years away. They are out of
        our reach for ever.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9989"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9991"><span data-line="9991"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What are the stars?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="9991"></span> said  O<span data-line="9991"></span>&#8216;Brien  indifferently.  &#8217;<span data-line="9991"></span><em class="em-low1">They
        are  bits of fire a few kilometres away. We could reach them if
        we wanted to. Or we could blot  them  out.  The  earth  is  the
        centre of the universe. The sun and the stars go round it.</em><span data-line="9994"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9994"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="9996"><span data-line="9996"></span>Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did
        not say  anything.  O<span data-line="9997"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9997"></span>Brien  continued  as  though  answering a
        spoken objection:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10000"><span data-line="10000"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">For certain purposes, of course, that is not  true.  When
        we  navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often
        find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the  sun
        and  that  the  stars  are millions upon millions of kilometres
        away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce
        a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near  or  distant,
        according  as  we  need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians
        are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10007"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10009"><span data-line="10009"></span>Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever  he  said,  the
        swift  answer  crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he
        knew, that he was in the right. The belief that  nothing
        exists  outside  your own mind — surely there must be some way
        of demonstrating that it was false? Had  it  not  been  exposed
        long  ago  as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he
        had forgotten. A faint smile twitched the corners of  O<span data-line="10015"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10015"></span>Brien<span data-line="10015"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10015"></span>s
        mouth as he looked down at him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10018"><span data-line="10018"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  told  you, Winston,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10018"></span> he said, <span data-line="10018"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">that metaphysics is not
        your strong point. The word you  are  trying  to  think  of  is
        solipsism.  But  you  are  mistaken.  This  is  not  solipsism.
        Collective solipsism, if you like.  But  that  is  a  different
        thing:  in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a digression,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10022"></span>
        he added in a different tone. <span data-line="10023"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The real  power,  the  power  we
        have  to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but
        over men.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10025"></span> He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of
        a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: <span data-line="10026"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">How does one man
        assert his power over another, Winston?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10027"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10029"><span data-line="10029"></span>Winston thought. <span data-line="10029"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">By making him suffer,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10029"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10031"><span data-line="10031"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is  not  enough.
        Unless  he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying
        your will and not his own? Power  is  in  inflicting  pain  and
        humiliation.  Power  is  in  tearing  human minds to pieces and
        putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.
        Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are  creating?
        It  is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that
        the old reformers imagined. A world of fear  and  treachery  is
        torment,  a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world
        which will grow  not  less  but  more  merciless  as  it
        refines  itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards
        more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded
        on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In  our  world
        there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and 
        self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already
        we  are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived
        from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child
        and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman.
        No one dares trust a wife or a child or a  friend  any  longer.
        But  in  the  future  there  will  be  no wives and no friends.
        Children will be taken from their  mothers  at  birth,  as  one
        takes  eggs  from  a  hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated.
        Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal  of  a
        ration  card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are
        at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty,  except  loyalty
        towards  the  Party.  There will be no love, except the love of
        Big Brother. There will be no laughter,  except  the  laugh  of
        triumph  over  a  defeated  enemy.  There  will  be  no art, no
        literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no
        more need of science. There  will  be  no  distinction  between
        beauty  and  ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment
        of the  process  of  life.  All  competing  pleasures  will  be
        destroyed.  But always — do not forget this, Winston — always
        there will be the intoxication of power, constantly  increasing
        and  constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there
        will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an
        enemy who is helpless. If you want a  picture  of  the  future,
        imagine a boot stamping on a human face — for ever.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10068"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10070"><span data-line="10070"></span>He  paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston
        had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again.  He
        could  not say anything. His heart seemed to be frozen. O<span data-line="10072"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10072"></span>Brien
        went on:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10075"><span data-line="10075"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And remember that it is for ever. The face will always be
        there to be stamped upon. The heretic, the  enemy  of  society,
        will always be there, so that he can be defeated and humiliated
        over  again.  Everything that you have undergone since you have
        been in our hands — all that will  continue,  and  worse.  The
        espionage,  the  betrayals,  the  arrests,  the  tortures,  the
        executions, the disappearances will never cease. It will  be  a
        world  of  terror  as  much as a world of triumph. The more the
        Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant: the weaker the
        opposition,  the  tighter  the  despotism.  Goldstein  and  his
        heresies  will  live for ever. Every day, at every moment, they
        will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed,  spat  upon  and  yet
        they  will  always  survive.  This drama that I have played out
        with you during seven years will be played out  over  and  over
        again  generation  after  generation,  always in subtler forms.
        Always we shall have the heretic here at our  mercy,  screaming
        with  pain,  broken  up, contemptible — and in the end utterly
        penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of  his  own
        accord.  That  is  the  world that we are preparing, Winston. A
        world of victory after victory,  triumph  after  triumph  after
        triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve
        of  power.  You  are beginning, I can see, to realize what that
        world will be like. But in  the  end  you  will  do  more  than
        understand  it.  You will accept it, welcome it, become part of
        it.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10099"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10101"><span data-line="10101"></span>Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak.  <span data-line="10101"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You
        can&#39;t!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10102"></span> he said weakly.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10104"><span data-line="10104"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What do you mean by that remark, Winston?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10104"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10106"><span data-line="10106"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  could  not  create  such  a  world  as you have just
        described. It is a dream. It is impossible.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10107"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10109"><span data-line="10109"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Why?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10109"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10111"><span data-line="10111"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It is impossible to found  a  civilization  on  fear  and
        hatred and cruelty. It would never endure.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10112"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10114"><span data-line="10114"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Why not?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10114"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10116"><span data-line="10116"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It  would  have  no  vitality.  It would disintegrate. It
        would commit suicide.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10117"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10119"><span data-line="10119"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Nonsense. You are under the  impression  that  hatred  is
        more  exhausting  than  love. Why should it be? And if it were,
        what difference would that make? Suppose that we choose to wear
        ourselves out faster. Suppose that  we  quicken  the  tempo  of
        human life till men are senile at thirty. Still what difference
        would  it  make?  Can  you not understand that the death of the
        individual is not death? The party is immortal.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10125"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10127"><span data-line="10127"></span>As  usual,   the   voice   had   battered   Winston   into
        helplessness.  Moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in
        his disagreement O<span data-line="10129"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10129"></span>Brien would twist the dial again. And yet he
        could not keep silent. Feebly, without arguments, with  nothing
        to  support  him except his inarticulate horror of what O<span data-line="10131"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10131"></span>Brien
        had said, he returned to the attack.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10134"><span data-line="10134"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I don&#39;t know — I don&#39;t  care.  Somehow  you  will  fail.
        Something will defeat you. Life will defeat you.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10135"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10137"><span data-line="10137"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We  control  life,  Winston,  at  all its levels. You are
        imagining that there is something  called  human  nature  which
        will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we
        create  human  nature. Men are infinitely malleable. Or perhaps
        you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the
        slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it out  of  your  mind.
        They are helpless, like the animals. Humanity is the Party. The
        others are outside — irrelevant.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10144"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10146"><span data-line="10146"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I  don&#39;t  care.  In the end they will beat you. Sooner or
        later they will see you for what you are, and  then  they  will
        tear you to pieces.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10148"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10150"><span data-line="10150"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do  you  see  any evidence that that is happening? Or any

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10153"><span data-line="10153"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No. I believe it. I know that you will fail. There
        is something in the universe — I don&#39;t know, some spirit, some
        principle — that you will never overcome.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10155"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10157"><span data-line="10157"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do you believe in God, Winston?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10157"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10159"><span data-line="10159"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10159"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10161"><span data-line="10161"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10161"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10163"><span data-line="10163"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I don&#39;t know. The spirit of Man.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10163"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10165"><span data-line="10165"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And do you consider yourself a man?.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10165"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10167"><span data-line="10167"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10167"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10169"><span data-line="10169"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">If you are a man, Winston, you are  the  last  man.  Your
        kind  is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you understand that
        you  are  alone?  You  are  outside  history,  you   are
        non-existent.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10172"></span>  His  manner  changed  and he said more harshly:
        <span data-line="10173"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And you consider yourself morally superior  to  us,  with  our
        lies and our cruelty?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10174"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10176"><span data-line="10176"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes, I consider myself superior.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10176"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10178"><span data-line="10178"></span>O<span data-line="10178"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10178"></span>Brien  did  not  speak.  Two other voices were speaking.
        After a moment Winston recognized one of them as  his  own.  It
        was  a sound-track of the conversation he had had with O<span data-line="10180"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10180"></span>Brien,
        on the night when he had enrolled himself in  the  Brotherhood.
        He  heard  himself  promising  to  lie,  to steal, to forge, to
        murder,  to  encourage   drug-taking   and   prostitution,   to
        disseminate  venereal  diseases,  to throw vitriol in a child<span data-line="10184"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10184"></span>s
        face. O<span data-line="10185"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10185"></span>Brien made a small impatient gesture, as though to  say
        that  the demonstration was hardly worth making. Then he turned
        a switch and the voices stopped.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10189"><span data-line="10189"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Get up from that bed,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10189"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10191"><span data-line="10191"></span>The bonds had loosened themselves. Winston lowered himself
        to the floor and stood up unsteadily.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10194"><span data-line="10194"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You are  the  last  man,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10194"></span>  said  O<span data-line="10194"></span>&#8216;Brien.  &#8217;<span data-line="10194"></span><em class="em-low1">You  are  the
        guardian  of  the  human  spirit. You shall see yourself as you
        are. Take off your clothes.</em><span data-line="10196"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10196"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10198"><span data-line="10198"></span>Winston undid the bit of string  that  held  his  overalls
        together.  The zip fastener had long since been wrenched out of
        them. He could not remember  whether  at  any  time  since  his
        arrest  he  had  taken off all his clothes at one time. Beneath
        the overalls his body was looped with  filthy  yellowish  rags,
        just  recognizable  as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid
        them to the ground he saw that there was a  three-sided  mirror
        at  the  far  end  of  the room. He approached it, then stopped
        short. An involuntary cry had broken out of him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10208"><span data-line="10208"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Go on,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10208"></span> said O<span data-line="10208"></span>&#8216;Brien. &#8217;<span data-line="10208"></span><em class="em-low1">Stand between  the  wings  of  the
        mirror. You shall see the side view as well.</em><span data-line="10209"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10209"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10211"><span data-line="10211"></span>He  had  stopped  because  he  was  frightened.  A  bowed,
        grey-coloured, skeleton-like thing was coming towards  him.  Its
        actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that
        he  knew  it  to  be himself. He moved closer to the glass. The
        creature<span data-line="10215"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10215"></span>s face seemed to be protruded,  because  of  its  bent
        carriage.  A  forlorn,  jailbird<span data-line="10216"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10216"></span>s  face  with a nobby forehead
        running  back  into  a  bald  scalp,  a   crooked   nose,   and
        battered-looking  cheekbones  above  which his eyes were fierce
        and watchful. The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a  drawn-in
        look.  Certainly it was his own face, but it seemed to him that
        it had changed more than he had changed inside. The emotions it
        registered would be different from the ones  he  felt.  He  had
        gone  partially  bald. For the first moment he had thought that
        he had gone grey as well, but it was only the  scalp  that  was
        grey.  Except  for his hands and a circle of his face, his body
        was grey all over with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and  there
        under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds, and near the
        ankle  the  varicose  ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of
        skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening  thing  was  the
        emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as
        that  of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were
        thicker than the thighs. He saw  now  what  O<span data-line="10232"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10232"></span>Brien  had  meant
        about  seeing  the  side  view.  The curvature of the spine was
        astonishing. The thin shoulders were hunched forward so  as  to
        make  a  cavity  of  the  chest,  the scraggy neck seemed to be
        bending double under the weight of the skull.  At  a  guess  he
        would  have  said  that  it  was  the  body  of a man of sixty,
        suffering from some malignant disease.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10240"><span data-line="10240"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You have thought sometimes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10240"></span> said O<span data-line="10240"></span>&#8216;Brien, &#8217;<span data-line="10240"></span><em class="em-low1">that my  face
        — the  face  of  a  member of the Inner Party — looks old and
        worn. What do you think of your own face?</em><span data-line="10242"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10242"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10244"><span data-line="10244"></span>He seized Winston<span data-line="10244"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10244"></span>s shoulder and spun him round so that he
        was facing him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10247"><span data-line="10247"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Look at the condition you are in!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10247"></span> he said. <span data-line="10247"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Look at this
        filthy grime all over your body. Look at the dirt between  your
        toes.  Look at that disgusting running sore on your leg. Do you
        know that you stink like a goat? Probably you  have  ceased  to
        notice  it.  Look at your emaciation. Do you see? I can make my
        thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep. I could  snap  your
        neck  like a carrot. Do you know that you have lost twenty-five
        kilograms since you have been in our hands? Even your  hair  is
        coming out in handfuls. Look!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10255"></span> He plucked at Winston<span data-line="10255"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10255"></span>s head and
        brought  away  a  tuft  of  hair.  <span data-line="10256"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Open your mouth. Nine, ten,
        eleven teeth left. How many had you when you came  to  us?  And
        the  few  you  have  left  are  dropping out of your head. Look
        here!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10259"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10261"><span data-line="10261"></span>He seized one of Winston<span data-line="10261"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10261"></span>s remaining front  teeth  between
        his  powerful  thumb  and  forefinger.  A  twinge  of pain shot
        through Winston<span data-line="10263"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10263"></span>s jaw. O<span data-line="10263"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10263"></span>Brien had wrenched the loose tooth out
        by the roots. He tossed it across the cell.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10266"><span data-line="10266"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You are rotting away,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10266"></span>  he  said;  <span data-line="10266"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">you  are  falling  to
        pieces.  What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn around and look
        into that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you?  That
        is  the  last  man. If you are human, that is humanity. Now put
        your clothes on again.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10270"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10272"><span data-line="10272"></span>Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff  movements.
        Until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was.
        Only one thought stirred in his mind: that he must have been in
        this  place  longer  than  he had imagined. Then suddenly as he
        fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling  of  pity  for
        his  ruined body overcame him. Before he knew what he was doing
        he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the  bed
        and  burst  into  tears.  He  was  aware  of  his ugliness, his
        gracelessness, a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting
        weeping in the  harsh  white  light:  but  he  could  not  stop
        himself. O<span data-line="10282"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10282"></span>Brien laid a hand on his shoulder, almost kindly.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10284"><span data-line="10284"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It will not last for ever,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10284"></span> he said. <span data-line="10284"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You can escape from
        it whenever you choose. Everything depends on yourself.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10285"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10287"><span data-line="10287"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  did  it!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10287"></span>  sobbed  Winston.  <span data-line="10287"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You reduced me to this
        state.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10288"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10290"><span data-line="10290"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you
        accepted when you set yourself up against the Party. It was all
        contained in that first act. Nothing has happened that you  did
        not foresee.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10293"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10295"><span data-line="10295"></span>He paused, and then went on:
</p>

        have seen what your body is like. Your  mind  is  in  the  same
        state.  I do not think there can be much pride left in you. You
        have been kicked and flogged and insulted,  you  have  screamed
        with  pain,  you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and
        vomit.  You  have  whimpered  for  mercy,  you  have   betrayed
        everybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation
        that has not happened to you?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10304"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10306"><span data-line="10306"></span>Winston  had  stopped weeping, though the tears were still
        oozing out of his eyes. He looked up at O<span data-line="10307"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10307"></span>Brien.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10309"><span data-line="10309"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I have not betrayed Julia,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10309"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10311"><span data-line="10311"></span>O<span data-line="10311"></span>&#8216;Brien looked down at him thoughtfully.  &#8217;<span data-line="10311"></span><em class="em-low1">No,</em><span data-line="10311"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10311"></span>  he  said;
        <span data-line="10312"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">no; that is perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10312"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10314"><span data-line="10314"></span>The  peculiar  reverence for O<span data-line="10314"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10314"></span>Brien, which nothing seemed
        able  to  destroy,   flooded   Winston<span data-line="10315"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10315"></span>s   heart   again.   How
        intelligent,  he  thought,  how  intelligent! Never did O<span data-line="10316"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10316"></span>Brien
        fail to understand what was said to him. Anyone else  on  earth
        would have answered promptly that he had betrayed Julia.
        For  what  was there that they had not screwed out of him under
        the torture? He had told them everything he knew about her, her
        habits, her character, her past life; he had confessed  in  the
        most  trivial  detail  everything  that  had  happened at their
        meetings, all that he had said to her and  she  to  him,  their
        black-market  meals,  their  adulteries,  their vague plottings
        against the Party — everything. And yet, in the sense in which
        he intended the word, he had  not  betrayed  her.  He  had  not
        stopped  loving  her; his feelings towards her had remained the
        same. O<span data-line="10328"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10328"></span>Brien had seen what  he  meant  without  the  need  for
        explanation.

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10333"><span data-line="10333"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It  might  be  a  long  time,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10333"></span>  said  O<span data-line="10333"></span>&#8216;Brien. &#8217;<span data-line="10333"></span><em class="em-low1">You are a

<p class="p noindent" data-line="10339"><span data-line="10339"></span>He  was  much  better.  He was growing fatter and stronger
        every day, if it was proper to speak of days.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10342"><span data-line="10342"></span>The white light and the humming sound  were  the  same  as
        ever,  but  the  cell  was  a  little more comfortable than the
        others he had been in. There was a pillow and a mattress on the
        plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They had given  him  a  bath,
        and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin
        basin.  They  even  gave  him warm water to wash with. They had
        given him new underclothes and a clean suit of  overalls.  They
        had dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment. They had
        pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given him a new set of
        dentures.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10353"><span data-line="10353"></span>Weeks  or  months  must  have  passed.  It would have been
        possible now to keep count of the passage of time,  if  he  had
        felt  any  interest in doing so, since he was being fed at what
        appeared to be regular intervals. He was  getting,  he  judged,
        three  meals  in  the  twenty-four hours; sometimes he wondered
        dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day. The  food
        was  surprisingly  good,  with  meat  at every third meal. Once
        there was even a packet of cigarettes. He had no  matches,  but
        the  never-speaking guard who brought his food would give him a
        light. The first time he tried to smoke it made him  sick,  but
        he persevered, and spun the packet out for a long time, smoking
        half a cigarette after each meal.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10366"><span data-line="10366"></span>They  had  given  him a white slate with a stump of pencil
        tied to the corner. At first he made no use of it. Even when he
        was awake he was completely torpid. Often he would lie from one
        meal to the next almost  without  stirring,  sometimes  asleep,
        sometimes  waking  into vague reveries in which it was too much
        trouble to open his eyes. He had long grown  used  to  sleeping
        with  a  strong  light  on  his  face.  It  seemed  to  make no
        difference, except that one<span data-line="10373"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10373"></span>s dreams  were  more  coherent.  He
        dreamed  a  great  deal  all  through  this time, and they were
        always happy dreams. He was in the Golden Country,  or  he  was
        sitting among enormous glorious, sunlit ruins, with his mother,
        with  Julia, with O<span data-line="10377"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10377"></span>Brien — not doing anything, merely sitting
        in the sun, talking of peaceful things. Such thoughts as he had
        when he was awake were mostly about his dreams.  He  seemed  to
        have  lost  the  power  of  intellectual  effort,  now that the
        stimulus of pain had been removed. He was not bored, he had  no
        desire for conversation or distraction. Merely to be alone, not
        to  be  beaten  or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be
        clean all over, was completely satisfying.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10386"><span data-line="10386"></span>By degrees he came to spend less time  in  sleep,  but  he
        still  felt no impulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was
        to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in  his  body.  He
        would  finger  himself here and there, trying to make sure that
        it was not an illusion that his muscles  were  growing  rounder
        and  his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond a doubt
        that he was growing fatter;  his  thighs  were  now  definitely
        thicker  than  his  knees. After that, reluctantly at first, he
        began exercising himself regularly. In a little while he  could
        walk  three  kilometres,  measured  by pacing the cell, and his
        bowed shoulders were  growing  straighter.  He  attempted  more
        elaborate  exercises, and was astonished and humiliated to find
        what things he could not do. He could not move out of  a  walk,
        he  could  not hold his stool out at arm<span data-line="10399"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10399"></span>s length, he could not
        stand on one leg without falling over. He squatted down on  his
        heels, and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he
        could  just lift himself to a standing position. He lay flat on
        his belly and tried to lift his weight by  his  hands.  It  was
        hopeless,  he could not raise himself a centimetre. But after a
        few more days — a few more mealtimes —  even  that  feat  was
        accomplished.  A  time  came  when  he  could  do  it six times
        running. He began to grow actually proud of his  body,  and  to
        cherish  an  intermittent belief that his face also was growing
        back to normal. Only when he chanced to put  his  hand  on  his
        bald  scalp  did  he  remember the seamed, ruined face that had
        looked back at him out of the mirror.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10413"><span data-line="10413"></span>His mind grew more active. He sat down on the  plank  bed,
        his  back  against the wall and the slate on his knees, and set
        to work deliberately at the task of re-educating himself.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10417"><span data-line="10417"></span>He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he saw
        now, he had been ready to capitulate long before he  had  taken
        the  decision.  From the moment when he was inside the Ministry
        of Love — and yes, even during those minutes when he and Julia
        had stood helpless while the iron  voice  from  the  telescreen
        told  them  what  to  do  —  he had grasped the frivolity, the
        shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the  power
        of  the  Party.  He  knew  now that for seven years the Thought
        police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying  glass.
        There  was no physical act, no word spoken aloud, that they had
        not noticed, no train of thought that they had not been able to
        infer. Even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary
        they had carefully replaced. They had  played  sound-tracks  to
        him,  shown  him  photographs. Some of them were photographs of
        Julia and himself. Yes, even … He could not  fight  against
        the  Party  any longer. Besides, the Party was in the right. It
        must be  so;  how  could  the  immortal,  collective  brain  be
        mistaken?  By  what  external  standard  could  you  check  its
        judgements? Sanity was statistical. It was merely a question of
        learning to think as they thought. Only!
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10438"><span data-line="10438"></span>The pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. He began
        to write down the thoughts that came into his  head.  He  wrote
        first in large clumsy capitals:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10442"><span data-line="10442"></span>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10444"><span data-line="10444"></span>Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10446"><span data-line="10446"></span>TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10448"><span data-line="10448"></span>But  then  there came a sort of check. His mind, as though
        shying away from something, seemed unable  to  concentrate.  He
        knew  that  he knew what came next, but for the moment he could
        not  recall  it.  When  he  did  recall  it,  it  was  only  by
        consciously  reasoning  out what it must be: it did not come of
        its own accord. He wrote:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10455"><span data-line="10455"></span>GOD IS POWER
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10457"><span data-line="10457"></span>He accepted everything. The past was alterable.  The  past
        never  had  been  altered.  Oceania  was  at war with Eastasia.
        Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. Jones,  Aaronson,
        and  Rutherford  were  guilty  of  the crimes they were charged
        with. He had never seen the  photograph  that  disproved  their
        guilt.  It had never existed, he had invented it. He remembered
        remembering contrary things, but  those  were  false  memories,
        products of self-deception. How easy it all was! Only surrender,
        and  everything  else  followed. It was like swimming against a
        current that swept you backwards however  hard  you  struggled,
        and  then  suddenly  deciding  to  turn  round  and go with the
        current instead of opposing it. Nothing had changed except your
        own attitude: the predestined thing happened in  any  case.  He
        hardly  knew  why  he  had  ever rebelled. Everything was easy,
        except!
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10473"><span data-line="10473"></span>Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature  were
        nonsense.  The  law  of  gravity  was  nonsense. <span data-line="10474"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">If I wished,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10474"></span>
        O<span data-line="10475"></span>&#8216;Brien had said, &#8217;<span data-line="10475"></span><em class="em-low1">I could float off this  floor  like  a  soap
        bubble.</em><span data-line="10476"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10476"></span>  Winston worked it out. <span data-line="10476"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">If he thinks he floats
        off the floor, and if I simultaneously think I  see  him
        do  it,  then  the  thing  happens.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10478"></span>  Suddenly,  like a lump of
        submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water,  the  thought
        burst  into his mind: <span data-line="10480"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It doesn&#39;t really happen. We imagine it.
        It is hallucination.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10481"></span> He pushed the  thought  under  instantly.
        The  fallacy  was  obvious.  It  presupposed  that somewhere or
        other, outside oneself, there was a <span data-line="10483"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">real</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10483"></span> world  where  <span data-line="10483"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">real</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10483"></span>
        things  happened.  But  how  could  there be such a world? What
        knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds?  All
        happenings  are  in  the  mind.  Whatever happens in all minds,
        truly happens.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10489"><span data-line="10489"></span>He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy,  and  he
        was   in   no   danger   of  succumbing  to  it.  He  realized,
        nevertheless, that it ought never to have occurred to him.  The
        mind  should  develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought
        presented itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive.
        Crimestop, they called it in Newspeak.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10496"><span data-line="10496"></span>He set to  work  to  exercise  himself  in  crimestop.  He
        presented  himself  with  propositions  —  <span data-line="10497"></span>&#8216;_the Party says the
        earth is flat&#8217;<span data-line="10498"></span>, <span data-line="10498"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">the party says that ice is heavier than water</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10498"></span>
        — and trained himself in not seeing or not  understanding  the
        arguments  that  contradicted  them. It was not easy. It needed
        great powers of reasoning and improvisation.  The  arithmetical
        problems  raised, for instance, by such a statement as <span data-line="10502"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">two and
        two make five</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10503"></span> were beyond his intellectual  grasp.  It  needed
        also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to
        make  the  most  delicate  use  of  logic and at the next to be
        unconscious of the crudest logical  errors.  Stupidity  was  as
        necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10509"><span data-line="10509"></span>All  the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how
        soon they would shoot him. <span data-line="10510"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Everything  depends  on  yourself,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10510"></span>
        O<span data-line="10511"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10511"></span>Brien  had  said; but he knew that there was no conscious act
        by which he could bring it nearer.  It  might  be  ten  minutes
        hence,  or ten years. They might keep him for years in solitary
        confinement, they might send him to a labour-camp,  they  might
        release  him  for  a  while,  as  they  sometimes  did.  It was
        perfectly possible that before he was shot the whole  drama  of
        his  arrest  and interrogation would be enacted all over again.
        The one certain thing was that death never came at an  expected
        moment.  The  tradition  — the unspoken tradition: somehow you
        knew it, though you never heard it said-was that they shot  you
        from  behind;  always in the back of the head, without warning,
        as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10524"><span data-line="10524"></span>One day — but <span data-line="10524"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">one day</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10524"></span> was  not  the  right  expression;
        just  as probably it was in the middle of the night: once — he
        fell into a strange, blissful reverie. He was walking down  the
        corridor, waiting for the bullet. He knew that it was coming in
        another   moment.   Everything   was   settled,  smoothed  out,
        reconciled. There were no more doubts, no  more  arguments,  no
        more  pain,  no  more fear. His body was healthy and strong. He
        walked easily, with a joy of movement and  with  a  feeling  of
        walking  in sunlight. He was not any longer in the narrow white
        corridors in the Ministry of  Love,  he  was  in  the  enormous
        sunlit  passage,  a kilometre wide, down which he had seemed to
        walk in the delirium induced by drugs. He  was  in  the  Golden
        Country,   following   the   foot-track   across   the   old
        rabbit-cropped pasture. He could feel the  short  springy  turf
        under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face. At the edge
        of  the  field  were  the  elm  trees,  faintly  stirring,  and
        somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in  the
        green pools under the willows.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10543"><span data-line="10543"></span>Suddenly  he  started up with a shock of horror. The sweat
        broke out on his backbone. He had heard himself cry aloud:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10546"><span data-line="10546"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10546"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10548"><span data-line="10548"></span>For a moment he had had an overwhelming  hallucination  of
        her  presence.  She  had  seemed to be not merely with him, but
        inside him. It was as though she had got into  the  texture  of
        his  skin. In that moment he had loved her far more than he had
        ever done when they were together and free. Also he  knew  that
        somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10555"><span data-line="10555"></span>He  lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. What
        had he done? How many years had he added to  his  servitude  by
        that moment of weakness?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10559"><span data-line="10559"></span>In  another  moment  he  would  hear  the  tramp  of boots
        outside. They could not let such  an  outburst  go  unpunished.
        They  would know now, if they had not known before, that he was
        breaking the agreement he had made with  them.  He  obeyed  the
        Party,  but  he  still  hated the Party. In the old days he had
        hidden a heretical mind beneath an  appearance  of  conformity.
        Now  he  had  retreated  a  step  further:  in  the mind he had
        surrendered,  but  he  had  hoped  to  keep  the  inner   heart
        inviolate.  He  knew that he was in the wrong, but he preferred
        to be in the wrong. They would understand that-  O<span data-line="10568"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10568"></span>Brien  would
        understand it. It was all confessed in that single foolish cry.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10571"><span data-line="10571"></span>He  would  have  to  start  all  over again. It might take
        years. He ran a hand  over  his  face,  trying  to  familiarize
        himself  with  the  new  shape.  There were deep furrows in the
        cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose flattened. Besides,
        since last seeing himself in the glass  he  had  been  given  a
        complete  new  set  of  teeth.  It  was  not  easy  to preserve
        inscrutability when you did not  know  what  your  face  looked
        like. In any case, mere control of the features was not enough.
        For  the  first  time  he  perceived that if you want to keep a
        secret you must also hide it from yourself. You must  know  all
        the  while  that  it  is there, but until it is needed you must
        never let it emerge into your consciousness in any  shape  that
        could  be given a name. From now onwards he must not only think
        right; he must feel right, dream right. And all  the  while  he
        must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter
        which  was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of
        him, a kind of cyst.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10589"><span data-line="10589"></span>One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell
        when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be
        possible to guess. It was always from behind,  walking  down  a
        corridor.  Ten  seconds would be enough. In that time the world
        inside him could turn over. And then suddenly, without  a  word
        uttered, without a check in his step, without the changing of a
        line  in  his face — suddenly the camouflage would be down and
        bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. Hatred  would  fill
        him  like  an  enormous  roaring  flame. And almost in the same
        instant bang! would go the bullet, too late, or too early. They
        would have blown his brain to pieces before they could  reclaim
        it.  The heretical thought would be unpunished, unrepented, out
        of their reach for ever. They would have blown a hole in  their
        own perfection. To die hating them, that was freedom.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10604"><span data-line="10604"></span>He  shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting an
        intellectual  discipline.  It  was  a  question  of   degrading
        himself,  mutilating  himself.  He  had  got to plunge into the
        filthiest of filth. What was the most horrible, sickening thing
        of all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous  face  (because
        of  constantly  seeing it on posters he always thought of it as
        being a metre wide), with its heavy  black  moustache  and  the
        eyes  that  followed  you  to and fro, seemed to float into his
        mind of its own accord. What were his true feelings towards Big
        Brother?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10615"><span data-line="10615"></span>There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. The steel
        door swung open with a clang. O<span data-line="10616"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10616"></span>Brien  walked  into  the  cell.
        Behind him were the waxen-faced officer and the black-uniformed
        guards.

<p class="p indent" data-line="10622"><span data-line="10622"></span>Winston   stood   opposite  him.  O<span data-line="10622"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10622"></span>Brien  took  Winston<span data-line="10622"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10622"></span>s
        shoulders between his strong hands and looked at him closely.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10625"><span data-line="10625"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You have had thoughts of deceiving me,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10625"></span>  he  said.  <span data-line="10625"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">That
        was stupid. Stand up straighter. Look me in the face.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10626"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10628"><span data-line="10628"></span>He paused, and went on in a gentler tone:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10630"><span data-line="10630"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  are  improving.  Intellectually there is very little
        wrong with you. It is only emotionally that you have failed  to
        make  progress.  Tell me, Winston — and remember, no lies: you
        know that I am always able to detect a lie — tell me, what are
        your true feelings towards Big Brother?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10634"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10636"><span data-line="10636"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I hate him.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10636"></span>

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10642"><span data-line="10642"></span>He released Winston with a little push towards the guards.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10644"><span data-line="10644"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Room 101,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10644"></span> he said.
</p><h2 id="sec--" class="h1" data-line="10646" data-heading-depth="1" style="display:block"><span data-line="10646"></span><span class="heading-before"><span class="heading-label">22</span>.&#8194;</span><span data-line="10646"></span> </h2>
<p class="p noindent" data-line="10648"><span data-line="10648"></span>At  each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed
        to  know,  whereabouts  he  was  in  the  windowless  building.
        Possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure. The
        cells  where the guards had beaten him were below ground level.
        The room where he had been interrogated by O<span data-line="10652"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10652"></span>Brien was high  up
        near  the roof. This place was many metres underground, as deep
        down as it was possible to go.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10656"><span data-line="10656"></span>It was bigger than most of the cells he had been  in.  But
        he  hardly  noticed  his  surroundings. All he noticed was that
        there were two small tables straight  in  front  of  him,  each
        covered with green baize. One was only a metre or two from him,
        the  other  was  further  away,  near the door. He was strapped
        upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing,  not
        even  his  head.  A  sort  of pad gripped his head from behind,
        forcing him to look straight in front of him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10665"><span data-line="10665"></span>For a moment he  was  alone,  then  the  door  opened  and
        O<span data-line="10666"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10666"></span>Brien came in.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10668"><span data-line="10668"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  asked me once,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10668"></span> said O<span data-line="10668"></span>&#8216;Brien, &#8217;<span data-line="10668"></span><em class="em-low1">what was in Room 101.
        I told you that you knew the answer already. Everyone knows it.
        The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world.</em><span data-line="10670"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10670"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10672"><span data-line="10672"></span>The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something
        made of wire, a box or basket of some kind. He set it  down  on
        the further table. Because of the position in which O<span data-line="10674"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10674"></span>Brien was
        standing. Winston could not see what the thing was.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10677"><span data-line="10677"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The worst thing in the world,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10677"></span> said O<span data-line="10677"></span>&#8216;Brien, &#8217;<span data-line="10677"></span><em class="em-low1">varies from
        individual  to  individual. It may be burial alive, or death by
        fire, or by drowning, or by impalement, or fifty other  deaths.
        There  are cases where it is some quite trivial thing, not even
        fatal.</em><span data-line="10681"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10681"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10683"><span data-line="10683"></span>He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston  had  a
        better  view  of  the thing on the table. It was an oblong wire
        cage with a handle on top for carrying  it  by.  Fixed  to  the
        front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask, with
        the concave side outwards. Although it was three or four metres
        away  from  him,  he  could  see  that  the  cage  was  divided
        lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind
        of creature in each. They were rats.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10692"><span data-line="10692"></span>&#8216;_In your case, said O&#39;Brien, &#8217;<span data-line="10692"></span><em class="em-low1">the worst thing in the world
        happens to be rats.</em><span data-line="10693"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10693"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10695"><span data-line="10695"></span>A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain
        what, had passed through Winston as soon as he caught his first
        glimpse of the cage. But at this  moment  the  meaning  of  the
        mask-like attachment in front of it suddenly sank into him. His
        bowels seemed to turn to water.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10701"><span data-line="10701"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You can&#39;t do that!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10701"></span> he cried out in a high cracked voice.
        <span data-line="10702"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You couldn&#39;t, you couldn&#39;t! It&#39;s impossible.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10702"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10704"><span data-line="10704"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do you remember,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10704"></span> said O<span data-line="10704"></span>&#8216;Brien, &#8217;<span data-line="10704"></span><em class="em-low1">the moment of panic that
        used to  occur in your dreams? There was a wall of blackness in
        front of you, and a roaring  sound  in  your  ears.  There  was
        something terrible on the other side of the wall. You knew that
        you  knew what it was, but you dared not drag it into the open.
        It was the rats that were on the other side of the wall.</em><span data-line="10709"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10709"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10711"><span data-line="10711"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">O&#39;Brien!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10711"></span> said Winston, making an effort to  control  his
        voice.  <span data-line="10712"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You  know  this  is not necessary. What is it that you
        want me to do?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10713"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10715"><span data-line="10715"></span>O<span data-line="10715"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10715"></span>Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in the
        schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes  affected.  He  looked
        thoughtfully into the distance, as though he were addressing an
        audience somewhere behind Winston<span data-line="10718"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10718"></span>s back.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10720"><span data-line="10720"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">By  itself,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10720"></span>  he  said, <span data-line="10720"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10720"></span>_<span data-line="10720"></span>pain is not always enough. There
        are occasions when a human being will stand out  against  pain,
        even to the point of death. But for everyone there is something
        unendurable  —  something that cannot be contemplated. Courage
        and cowardice are not involved.  If  you  are  falling  from  a
        height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come
        up  from  deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with
        air. It is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. It  is
        the same with the rats. For you, they are unendurable. They are
        a  form  of  pressure  that  you  cannot withstand. even if you
        wished to. You will do what is required of you.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10732"><span data-line="10732"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">But what is it, what is it? How can I do it  if  I  don&#39;t
        know what it is?</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10733"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10735"><span data-line="10735"></span>O<span data-line="10735"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10735"></span>Brien  picked  up  the cage and brought it across to the
        nearer table. He set it down  carefully  on  the  baize  cloth.
        Winston  could  hear  the blood singing in his ears. He had the
        feeling of sitting in utter loneliness. He was in the middle of
        a great empty plain, a  flat  desert  drenched  with  sunlight,
        across  which  all sounds came to him out of immense distances.
        Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres  away  from  him.
        They  were  enormous  rats.  They  were at the age when a rat<span data-line="10742"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10742"></span>s
        muzzle grows blunt and fierce and  his  fur  brown  instead  of
        grey.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10746"><span data-line="10746"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The  rat,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10746"></span>  said  O<span data-line="10746"></span>&#8216;Brien, still addressing his invisible
        audience, &#8217;<span data-line="10747"></span><em class="em-low1">although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware  of
        that. You will have heard of the things that happen in the poor
        quarters  of  this town. In some streets a woman dare not leave
        her baby alone in the house, even for five  minutes.  The  rats
        are  certain  to attack it. Within quite a small time they will
        strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or  dying  people.
        They  show  astonishing  intelligence  in  knowing when a human
        being is helpless.</em><span data-line="10754"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10754"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10756"><span data-line="10756"></span>There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It  seemed
        to  reach  Winston  from far away. The rats were fighting; they
        were trying to get at each  other  through  the  partition.  He
        heard  also  a deep groan of despair. That, too, seemed to come
        from outside himself.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10762"><span data-line="10762"></span>O<span data-line="10762"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10762"></span>Brien picked up the cage, and, as  he  did  so,  pressed
        something  in  it.  There  was  a  sharp  click. Winston made a
        frantic effort to tear himself loose from  the  chair.  It  was
        hopeless; every part of him, even his head, was held immovably.
        O<span data-line="10766"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10766"></span>Brien  moved  the  cage nearer. It was less than a metre from
        Winston<span data-line="10767"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10767"></span>s face.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10769"><span data-line="10769"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I have pressed  the  first  lever,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10769"></span>  said  O<span data-line="10769"></span>&#8216;Brien.  &#8217;<span data-line="10769"></span><em class="em-low1">You
        understand  the  construction  of  this cage. The mask will fit
        over your head, leaving no exit. When I press this other lever,
        the door of the cage will slide up. These starving brutes  will
        shoot  out  of  it  like bullets. Have you ever seen a rat leap
        through the air? They will  leap  on  to  your  face  and  bore
        straight  into  it.  Sometimes  they  attack  the  eyes  first.
        Sometimes  they  burrow  through  the  cheeks  and  devour  the
        tongue.</em><span data-line="10777"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10777"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10779"><span data-line="10779"></span>The  cage  was  nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a
        succession of shrill cries which appeared to  be  occurring  in
        the  air  above  his  head. But he fought furiously against his
        panic. To think, to think, even with a split second left —  to
        think  was  the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty odour of the
        brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent  convulsion  of
        nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything
        had  gone  black.  For  an  instant  he was insane, a screaming
        animal. Yet he came out of the  blackness  clutching  an  idea.
        There  was  one  and  only  one  way  to  save himself. He must
        interpose another human being, the body of another human
        being, between himself and the rats.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10792"><span data-line="10792"></span>The circle of the mask was large enough now  to  shut  out
        the  vision  of  anything  else.  The wire door was a couple of
        hand-spans from his face. The rats knew what  was  coming  now.
        One  of  them  was leaping up and down, the other, an old scaly
        grandfather of the  sewers,  stood  up,  with  his  pink  hands
        against  the  bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could
        see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again  the  black  panic
        took hold of him. He was blind, helpless, mindless.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10801"><span data-line="10801"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It  was  a  common  punishment  in  Imperial China,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10801"></span> said
        O<span data-line="10802"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10802"></span>Brien as didactically as ever.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10804"><span data-line="10804"></span>The mask was closing on his face.  The  wire  brushed  his
        cheek.  And  then  —  no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny
        fragment of hope. Too  late,  perhaps  too  late.  But  he  had
        suddenly  understood  that  in  the  whole world there was just
        one person to whom he could transfer his  punishment  —
        one  body  that  he could thrust between himself and the
        rats. And he was shouting frantically, over and over.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10812"><span data-line="10812"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me!  Julia!  I  don&#39;t

</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10816"><span data-line="10816"></span>He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away  from
        the rats. He was still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen
        through  the  floor, through the walls of the building, through
        the earth, through the oceans,  through  the  atmosphere,  into
        outer  space,  into the gulfs between the stars — always away,
        away, away from the rats.  He  was  light  years  distant,  but
        O<span data-line="10822"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10822"></span>Brien  was  still  standing  at his side. There was still the
        cold touch of wire against his cheek. But through the  darkness
        that  enveloped  him  he heard another metallic click, and knew
        that the cage door had clicked shut and not open.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="10829"><span data-line="10829"></span>The Chestnut Tree was almost  empty.  A  ray  of  sunlight
        slanting  through a window fell on dusty table-tops. It was the
        lonely hour  of  fifteen.  A  tinny  music  trickled  from  the
        telescreens.

<p class="p indent" data-line="10834"><span data-line="10834"></span>Winston  sat  in  his  usual  corner, gazing into an empty
        glass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast  face  which  eyed
        him  from  the  opposite wall. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the
        caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and filled his  glass  up
        with  Victory  Gin,  shaking  into  it a few drops from another
        bottle with  a  quill  through  the  cork.  It  was  saccharine
        flavoured with cloves, the speciality of the café.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10842"><span data-line="10842"></span>Winston  was  listening to the telescreen. At present only
        music was coming out of it, but there was a possibility that at
        any moment there might be a special bulletin from the  Ministry
        of  Peace.  The  news from the African front was disquieting in
        the extreme. On and off he had been worrying about it all  day.
        A  Eurasian  army (Oceania was at war with Eurasia: Oceania had
        always been at  war  with  Eurasia)  was  moving  southward  at
        terrifying  speed.  The  mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any
        definite area, but it was probable that already  the  mouth  of
        the  Congo was a battlefield. Brazzaville and Leopoldville were
        in danger. One did not have to look at the map to see  what  it
        meant.  It  was not merely a question of losing Central Africa:
        for the first time in the whole war, the territory  of  Oceania
        itself was menaced.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10857"><span data-line="10857"></span>A  violent  emotion,  not  fear  exactly  but  a  sort  of
        undifferentiated excitement,  flared  up  in  him,  then  faded
        again.  He  stopped  thinking  about  the war. In these days he
        could never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few
        moments at a time. He picked up his glass and drained it  at  a
        gulp.  As  always,  the  gin  made  him  shudder and even retch
        slightly. The stuff was horrible. The  cloves  and  saccharine,
        themselves  disgusting  enough  in  their sickly way, could not
        disguise the flat oily smell; and what was  worst  of  all  was
        that  the smell of gin, which dwelt with him night and day, was
        inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of those —
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10869"><span data-line="10869"></span>He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so  far  as
        it  was  possible he never visualized them. They were something
        that he was half-aware of, hovering close to his face, a  smell
        that  clung  to his nostrils. As the gin rose in him he belched
        through purple lips. He had grown fatter  since  they  released
        him,  and  had  regained  his  old  colour — indeed, more than
        regained it. His features had thickened, the skin on  nose  and
        cheekbones was coarsely red, even the bald scalp was too deep a
        pink.  A waiter, again unbidden, brought the chessboard and the
        current issue of The Times, with the page turned down at
        the chess problem. Then, seeing that Winston<span data-line="10879"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10879"></span>s glass was empty,
        he brought the gin bottle and filled it. There was no  need  to
        give  orders.  They  knew his habits. The chessboard was always
        waiting for him, his corner table  was  always  reserved;  even
        when  the  place  was  full  he had it to himself, since nobody
        cared to be seen sitting  too  close  to  him.  He  never  even
        bothered  to  count  his  drinks.  At  irregular intervals they
        presented him with a dirty slip of paper which  they  said  was
        the   bill,   but  he  had  the  impression  that  they  always
        undercharged him. It would have made no difference  if  it  had
        been  the  other  way  about.  He  had  always  plenty of money
        nowadays. He even had a job, a sinecure, more highly-paid  than
        his old job had been.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10893"><span data-line="10893"></span>The  music  from  the  telescreen stopped and a voice took
        over. Winston raised his head to listen. No bulletins from  the
        front,  however.  It  was  merely a brief announcement from the
        Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter, it appeared,  the
        Tenth   Three-Year   Plan<span data-line="10897"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10897"></span>s   quota   for   bootlaces  had  been
        overfulfilled by 98 per cent.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10900"><span data-line="10900"></span>He examined the chess problem and set out the  pieces.  It
        was  a  tricky ending, involving a couple of knights. <span data-line="10901"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">White to
        play and mate in two moves.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10902"></span> Winston looked up at the  portrait
        of  Big  Brother. White always mates, he thought with a sort of
        cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is so arranged.
        In no chess problem since the beginning of the world has  black
        ever  won.  Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying triumph
        of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back  at  him,  full  of
        calm power. White always mates.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10910"><span data-line="10910"></span>The  voice  from  the  telescreen  paused  and  added in a
        different and much graver tone: <span data-line="10911"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You are warned to stand by for
        an important announcement at fifteen-thirty.  Fifteen-thirty!
        This  is  news of the highest importance. Take care not to miss
        it. Fifteen-thirty!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10914"></span> The tinking music struck up again.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10916"><span data-line="10916"></span>Winston<span data-line="10916"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10916"></span>s heart stirred. That was the  bulletin  from  the
        front;  instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming.
        All day, with little spurts of excitement,  the  thought  of  a
        smashing  defeat  in Africa had been in and out of his mind. He
        seemed actually to see the Eurasian army  swarming  across  the
        never-broken  frontier  and pouring down into the tip of Africa
        like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to outflank
        them in some way? The outline of the West African  coast  stood
        out  vividly  in  his  mind.  He picked up the white knight and
        moved it across the board. There was  the  proper  spot.
        Even  while  he  saw  the  black  horde racing southward he saw
        another force,  mysteriously  assembled,  suddenly  planted  in
        their  rear,  cutting  their  comunications by land and sea. He
        felt that by willing it he was bringing that other  force  into
        existence.  But  it was necessary to act quickly. If they could
        get control of the whole of Africa, if they had  airfields  and
        submarine  bases  at  the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two. It
        might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision  of  the
        world,  the destruction of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An
        extraordinary medley  of  feeling-but  it  was  not  a  medley,
        exactly;  rather  it was successive layers of feeling, in which
        one could not say which layer was  undermost  struggled  inside
        him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10940"><span data-line="10940"></span>The  spasm  passed.  He  put  the white knight back in its
        place, but for the moment he could not settle down  to  serious
        study of the chess problem. His thoughts wandered again. Almost
        unconsciously  he  traced  with  his  finger in the dust on the
        table:
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10946"><span data-line="10946"></span>2<span data-line="10946"></span> <span data-line="10946"></span>+ 2 = 
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10948"><span data-line="10948"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">They can&#39;t get inside you,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10948"></span> she had said. But they  could
        get  inside you. <span data-line="10949"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What happens to you here is for ever,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="10949"></span>
        O<span data-line="10950"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10950"></span>Brien had said. That was a true word. There were things, your
        own acts, from which you could  never  recover.  Something  was
        killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10954"><span data-line="10954"></span>He  had  seen her; he had even spoken to her. There was no
        danger in it. He knew as though  instinctively  that  they  now
        took  almost  no interest in his doings. He could have arranged
        to meet her a second time if either  of  them  had  wanted  to.
        Actually  it  was  by  chance  that they had met. It was in the
        Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth  was  like
        iron  and  all  the  grass  seemed dead and there was not a bud
        anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed  themselves  up
        to  be  dismembered  by  the  wind.  He was hurrying along with
        frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not  ten  metres
        away  from  him.  It struck him at once that she had changed in
        some ill-defined way. They almost passed one another without  a
        sign,  then  he  turned  and followed her, not very eagerly. He
        knew that there was no danger, nobody would take  any  interest
        in him. She did not speak. She walked obliquely away across the
        grass as though trying to get rid of him, then seemed to resign
        herself to having him at her side. Presently they were in among
        a   clump   of  ragged  leafless  shrubs,  useless  either  for
        concealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. It was
        vilely cold. The wind whistled through the  twigs  and  fretted
        the  occasional,  dirty-looking  crocuses. He put his arm round
        her waist.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10977"><span data-line="10977"></span>There  was  no  telescreen,  but  there  must  be   hidden
        microphones:  besides,  they  could be seen. It did not matter,
        nothing mattered. They could have lain down on the  ground  and
        done  that  if  they had wanted to. His flesh froze with
        horror at the thought of it. She made no response  whatever  to
        the  clasp  of  his  arm  ;  she  did not even try to disengage
        herself. He knew now what had changed  in  her.  Her  face  was
        sallower, and there was a long scar, partly hidden by the hair,
        across her forehead and temple; but that was not the change. It
        was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a surprising way,
        had stiffened. He remembered how once, after the explosion of a
        rocket  bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins,
        and had been astonished not only by the  incredible  weight  of
        the thing, but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which
        made  it  seem  more  like stone than flesh. Her body felt like
        that. It occurred to him that the texture of her skin would  be
        quite different from what it had once been.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="10995"><span data-line="10995"></span>He  did  not  attempt  to kiss her, nor did they speak. As
        they walked back across the grass, she looked directly  at  him
        for  the  first  time.  It was only a momentary glance, full of
        contempt and dislike. He wondered whether it was a dislike that
        came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also  by
        his  bloated  face  and  the water that the wind kept squeezing
        from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side  by  side
        but not too close together. He saw that she was about to speak.
        She  moved  her  clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately
        crushed a twig. Her feet  seemed  to  have  grown  broader,  he
        noticed.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11007"><span data-line="11007"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I betrayed you,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11007"></span> she said baldly.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11009"><span data-line="11009"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I betrayed you,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11009"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11011"><span data-line="11011"></span>She gave him another quick look of dislike.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11013"><span data-line="11013"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Sometimes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11013"></span>  she  said, <span data-line="11013"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">they threaten you with something
        something you can&#39;t stand up to, can&#39;t even  think  about.  And
        then you say, &#8220;Don&#39;t do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it
        to  So-and-so.&#8221; And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that
        it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop
        and didn&#39;t really mean it. But that isn&#39;t  true.  At  the  time
        when  it happens you do mean it. You think there&#39;s no other way
        of saving yourself, and you&#39;re quite  ready  to  save  yourself
        that way. You want it to happen to the other person. You
        don&#39;t  give  a  damn  what  they  suffer. All you care about is
        yourself.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11023"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11025"><span data-line="11025"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">All you care about is yourself,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11025"></span> he echoed.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11027"><span data-line="11027"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">And after that, you don&#39;t feel the same towards the other
        person any longer.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11028"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11030"><span data-line="11030"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">No,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11030"></span> he said, <span data-line="11030"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">you don&#39;t feel the same.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11030"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11032"><span data-line="11032"></span>There did not seem to be anything more to  say.  The  wind
        plastered  their  thin overalls against their bodies. Almost at
        once it became embarrassing to sit there in  silence:  besides,
        it  was  too  cold  to  keep  still.  She  said something about
        catching her Tube and stood up to go.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11038"><span data-line="11038"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">We must meet again,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11038"></span> he said.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11040"><span data-line="11040"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Yes,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11040"></span> she said, <span data-line="11040"></span>&#8216;_we must meet again. &#8217;<span data-line="11040"></span>_<span data-line="11040"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11042"><span data-line="11042"></span>He followed irresolutely for a  little  distance,  half  a
        pace behind her. They did not speak again. She did not actually
        try  to  shake  him  off, but walked at just such a speed as to
        prevent his keeping abreast of her. He had  made  up  his  mind
        that  he  would  accompany  her as far as the Tube station, but
        suddenly this process of trailing  along  in  the  cold  seemed
        pointless and unbearable. He was overwhelmed by a desire not so
        much to get away from Julia as to get back to the Chestnut Tree
        Café,  which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment.
        He had a  nostalgic  vision  of  his  corner  table,  with  the
        newspaper  and  the  chessboard  and the ever-flowing gin. Above
        all, it would be warm in there. The next moment, not altogether
        by accident, he allowed himself to become separated from her by
        a small knot of people. He made a halfhearted attempt to  catch
        up,  then  slowed  down,  turned,  and made off in the opposite
        direction. When he had gone fifty metres he  looked  back.  The
        street  was  not  crowded, but already he could not distinguish
        her. Any one of a dozen hurrying figures might have been  hers.
        Perhaps   her   thickened,   stiffened   body   was  no  longer
        recognizable from behind.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11063"><span data-line="11063"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">At the time when it happens,</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11063"></span> she had said, <span data-line="11063"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">you do  mean
        it.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11064"></span>  He had meant it. He had not merely said it, he had wished
        it. He had wished that she and not he should be delivered  over
        to the-
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11068"><span data-line="11068"></span>Something  changed  in  the  music  that trickled from the
        telescreen. A cracked and jeering note,  a  yellow  note,  came
        into  it.  And then — perhaps it was not happening, perhaps it
        was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound —  a  voice
        was singing:
</p>
<pre class="para-block pre-indented" data-line="11074" style="display:block"><code>         &#39;_Under the spreading chestnut tree
         I sold you and you sold me &#39;_</code></pre>
<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="11077"><span data-line="11077"></span>The  tears welled up in his eyes. A passing waiter noticed
        that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11080"><span data-line="11080"></span>He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grew not
        less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank. But it had
        become the element he swam in. It was his life, his death,  and
        his  resurrection.  It  was gin that sank him into stupor every
        night, and gin that revived him every morning.  When  he  woke,
        seldom  before eleven hundred, with gummed-up eyelids and fiery
        mouth and a back that seemed to be broken, it would  have  been
        impossible  even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been
        for the bottle and teacup  placed  beside  the  bed  overnight.
        Through  the  midday  hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle
        handy,  listening  to   the   telescreen.   From   fifteen   to
        closing-time  he  was  a  fixture  in the Chestnut Tree. No one
        cared  what  he  did  any  longer,  no  whistle  woke  him,  no
        telescreen  admonished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week,
        he went to a dusty, forgotten-looking office in the Ministry of
        Truth and did a little work, or what was called  work.  He  had
        been  appointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which had
        sprouted from one of the innumerable  committees  dealing  with
        minor  difficulties  that  arose  in  the  compilation  of  the
        Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. They were  engaged
        in  producing  something  called an Interim Report, but what it
        was that they were reporting on he had never  definitely  found
        out. It was something to do with the question of whether commas
        should  be  placed inside brackets, or outside. There were four
        others on  the  committee,  all  of  them  persons  similar  to
        himself.  There were days when they assembled and then promptly
        dispersed again, frankly admitting to one  another  that  there
        was  not  really anything to be done. But there were other days
        when they settled down to their work almost eagerly,  making  a
        tremendous  show of entering up their minutes and drafting long
        memoranda which were never finished — when the argument as  to
        what  they  were  supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarily
        involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling  over  definitions,
        enormous  digressions,  quarrels  threats,  even,  to appeal to
        higher authority. And then suddenly the life would  go  out  of
        them  and they would sit round the table looking at one another
        with extinct eyes, like ghosts fading at cock-crow.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11118"><span data-line="11118"></span>The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised his
        head again. The bulletin! But no, they were merely changing the
        music. He had  the  map  of  Africa  behind  his  eyelids.  The
        movement  of  the  armies  was a diagram: a black arrow tearing
        vertically southward, and a white arrow horizontally  eastward,
        across  the  tail  of  the  first. As though for reassurance he
        looked up at the imperturbable face in  the  portrait.  Was  it
        conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist?
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11127"><span data-line="11127"></span>His  interest  flagged again. He drank another mouthful of
        gin, picked up the white knight  and  made  a  tentative  move.
        Check. But it was evidently not the right move, because
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11131"><span data-line="11131"></span>Uncalled,  a  memory  floated  into  his  mind.  He  saw a
        candle-lit  room  with  a  vast  white-counterpaned  bed,   and
        himself,  a boy of nine or ten, sitting on the floor, shaking a
        dice-box,  and  laughing  excitedly.  His  mother  was  sitting
        opposite him and also laughing.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11137"><span data-line="11137"></span>It must have been about a month before she disappeared. It
        was a  moment of reconciliation, when the nagging hunger in his
        belly was forgotten and  his  earlier  affection  for  her  had
        temporarily  revived.  He  remembered  the day well, a pelting,
        drenching day when the water streamed down the window-pane  and
        the  light  indoors was too dull to read by. The boredom of the
        two children in the dark, cramped  bedroom  became  unbearable.
        Winston  whined  and  grizzled,  made  futile demands for food,
        fretted about the room pulling  everything  out  of  place  and
        kicking  the  wainscoting  until  the  neighbours banged on the
        wall, while the younger child wailed intermittently. In the end
        his mother said, <span data-line="11148"></span>&#8216;_Now be good, and I&#39;Il buy you a toy. A lovely
        toy — you&#39;ll love it&#8217;<span data-line="11149"></span>; and then she had gone out in the  rain,
        to  a  little  general  shop  which was still sporadically open
        nearby, and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit
        of Snakes and Ladders. He could still remember the smell of the
        damp cardboard. It  was  a  miserable  outfit.  The  board  was
        cracked  and  the  tiny  wooden  dice were so ill-cut that they
        would hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked  at  the  thing
        sulkily  and  without interest. But then his mother lit a piece
        of candle and they sat down on the floor to play. Soon  he  was
        wildly  excited  and shouting with laughter as the tiddly-winks
        climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering  down
        the  snakes  again,  almost to the starting- point. They played
        eight games, winning four each. His tiny sister, too  young  to
        understand  what the game was about, had sat propped up against
        a bolster, laughing because the others  were  laughing.  For  a
        whole  afternoon  they  had  all been happy together, as in his
        earlier childhood.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11167"><span data-line="11167"></span>He pushed the picture out of his  mind.  It  was  a  false
        memory.  He  was  troubled by false memories occasionally. They
        did not matter so long as one knew them  for  what  they  were.
        Some  things  had  happened, others had not happened. He turned
        back to the chessboard and picked up the  white  knight  again.
        Almost  in  the  same instant it dropped on to the board with a
        clatter. He had started as though a pin had run into him.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11175"><span data-line="11175"></span>A shrill trumpet-call had pierced  the  air.  It  was  the
        bulletin! Victory! It always meant victory when a trumpet-call
        preceded  the  news.  A  sort of electric drill ran through the
        café. Even the waiters had started and pricked up their ears.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11180"><span data-line="11180"></span>The trumpet-call had  let  loose  an  enormous  volume  of
        noise.   Already   an  excited  voice  was  gabbling  from  the
        telescreen, but even as it started it was almost drowned  by  a
        roar  of  cheering  from  outside.  The  news had run round the
        streets like magic. He could  hear  just  enough  of  what  was
        issuing  from  the  telescreen  to  realize  that  it  had  all
        happened, as he  had  foreseen;  a  vast  seaborne  armada  had
        secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy<span data-line="11187"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11187"></span>s rear, the white
        arrow  tearing  across  the  tail  of  the  black. Fragments of
        triumphant phrases pushed themselves  through  the  din:  <span data-line="11189"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Vast
        strategic  manoeuvre  — perfect co-ordination — utter rout —
        half a million prisoners — complete demoralization —  control
        of  the  whole  of  Africa  —  bring the war within measurable
        distance of its  end  victory  —  greatest  victory  in  human
        history — victory, victory, victory!</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11194"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11196"><span data-line="11196"></span>Under  the table Winston<span data-line="11196"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11196"></span>s feet made convulsive movements.
        He had not stirred from his  seat,  but  in  his  mind  he  was
        running,  swiftly  running,  he  was  with  the crowds outside,
        cheering himself deaf. He looked up again at  the  portrait  of
        Big  Brother.  The  colossus that bestrode the world! The rock
        against which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain! He
        thought how ten minutes ago-yes, only ten minutes — there  had
        still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the
        news  from  the front would be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was
        more than a Eurasian army that had perished! Much  had  changed
        in  him  since  that first day in the Ministry of Love, but the
        final, indispensable, healing change had never happened,  until
        this moment.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11210"><span data-line="11210"></span>The  voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its
        tale of prisoners and booty and  slaughter,  but  the  shouting
        outside  had  died down a little. The waiters were turning back
        to their work. One of them  approached  with  the  gin  bottle.
        Winston,  sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention as his
        glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any longer.
        He was back in the Ministry of Love, with everything  forgiven,
        his  soul  white as snow. He was in the public dock, confessing
        everything, implicating everybody.  He  was  walking  down  the
        white-tiled  corridor, with the feeling of walking in sunlight,
        and an armed guard at his back. The  longhoped-for  bullet  was
        entering his brain.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11223"><span data-line="11223"></span>He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had taken
        him to  learn  what  kind  of smile was hidden beneath the dark
        moustache. O  cruel,  needless  misunderstanding!  O  stubborn,
        self-willed exile from the loving breast! Two gin-scented tears
        trickled  down  the  sides  of  his nose. But it was all right,
        everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won
        the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.

<p class="p noindent" data-line="11233"><span data-line="11233"></span><strong class="strong-star2">The Principles of Newspeak</strong><span data-line="11233"></span>
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11235"><span data-line="11235"></span>Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been
        devised to meet the ideological needs  of  Ingsoc,  or  English
        Socialism.  In  the  year  1984 there was not as yet anyone who
        used Newspeak as his sole means  of  communication,  either  in
        speech  or  writing.  The  leading articles in The Times
        were written in it, but this was a tour de  force  which
        could only be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that
        Newspeak  would  have  finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard
        English, as  we  should  call  it)  by  about  the  year  2050.
        Meanwhile  it gained ground steadily, all Party members tending
        to use Newspeak words and grammatical  constructions  more  and
        more  in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, and
        embodied in the  Ninth  and  Tenth  Editions  of  the  Newspeak
        Dictionary,   was   a   provisional  one,  and  contained  many
        superfluous words and archaic formations which were due  to  be
        suppressed  later.  It is with the final, perfected version, as
        embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary, that we are
        concerned here.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11254"><span data-line="11254"></span>The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide  a  medium
        of  expression  for  the world-view and mental habits proper to
        the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of  thought
        impossible. It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted
        once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought —
        that  is,  a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc —
        should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought  is
        dependent  on  words.  Its  vocabulary was so constructed as to
        give exact and often very subtle expression  to  every  meaning
        that  a  Party  member  could  properly  wish to express, while
        excluding all  other  meanings  and  also  the  possibility  of
        arriving  at  them by indirect methods. This was done partly by
        the  invention  of  new  words,  but  chiefly  by   eliminating
        undesirable  words  and  by stripping such words as remained of
        unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible  of  all  secondary
        meanings   whatever.   To  give  a  single  example.  The  word
        free still existed in Newspeak, but  it  could  only  be
        used  in  such  statements  as  <span data-line="11271"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">This dog is free from lice</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11271"></span> or
        <span data-line="11272"></span>&#8216;_This field is free from weeds&#8217;<span data-line="11272"></span>. It could not be  used  in  its
        old sense of <span data-line="11273"></span><em class="em-low1">&#39; politically free</em><span data-line="11273"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11273"></span> or <span data-line="11273"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">intellectually free</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11273"></span> since
        political  and  intellectual  freedom no longer existed even as
        concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless. Quite apart
        from the suppression of definitely heretical  words,  reduction
        of  vocabulary  was  regarded  as an end in itself, and no word
        that could be dispensed with was allowed to  survive.  Newspeak
        was  designed not to extend but to diminish the range of
        thought, and this purpose was indirectly  assisted  by  cutting
        the choice of words down to a minimum.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11283"><span data-line="11283"></span>Newspeak  was  founded  on  the English language as we now
        know  it,  though  many  Newspeak  sentences,  even  when   not
        containing newly-created words, would be barely intelligible to
        an  English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak words were divided
        into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary,  the  B
        vocabulary  (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary.
        It will be simpler to discuss each class  separately,  but  the
        grammatical  peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in
        the section devoted to the A vocabulary, since the  same  rules
        held good for all three categories.
</p><h5 id="sec-the-a-vocabulary" class="h4" data-line="11294" data-heading-depth="4" style="display:block"><span data-line="11294"></span>The A vocabulary</h5>
<p class="p noindent" data-line="11296"><span data-line="11296"></span>The A vocabulary consisted of the
        words  needed  for  the  business  of everyday life — for such
        things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one<span data-line="11298"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11298"></span>s  clothes,
        going  up  and  down  stairs,  riding  in  vehicles, gardening,
        cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely of words
        that we already possess words  like  hit,  run,  dog,  tree,
        sugar,   house,   field  —  but  in  comparison  with  the
        present-day  English  vocabulary  their  number  was  extremely
        small,  while their meanings were far more rigidly defined. All
        ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of  them.
        So  far  as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class
        was simply  a  staccato  sound  expressing  one  clearly
        understood  concept. It would have been quite impossible to use
        the A vocabulary for literary  purposes  or  for  political  or
        philosophical  discussion.  It  was  intended  only  to express
        simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete  objects
        or physical actions.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11314"><span data-line="11314"></span>The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities.
        The first  of  these  was an almost complete interchangeability
        between different parts of speech. Any word in the language (in
        principle this applied even to  very  abstract  words  such  as
        if  or  when) could be used either as verb, noun,
        adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form,  when
        they were of the same root, there was never any variation, this
        rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms.
        The   word  thought,  for  example,  did  not  exist  in
        Newspeak. Its place was taken by think, which  did  duty
        for  both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed
        here: in some cases it was the original noun  that  was  chosen
        for  retention,  in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and
        verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected,  one
        or  other  of  them  was  frequently suppressed. There was, for
        example,  no  such  word  as  cut,  its  meaning   being
        sufficiently  covered by the noun-verb knife. Adjectives
        were formed by adding the suffix-ful to  the  noun-verb,
        and   adverbs   by   adding<span data-line="11332"></span> <span data-line="11332"></span> <span data-line="11332"></span>-wise.  Thus  for  example,
        speedful  meant  <span data-line="11333"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">rapid</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11333"></span>  and   speedwise   meant
        <span data-line="11334"></span>&#8216;_quickly&#8217;<span data-line="11334"></span>.  Certain  of  our  present-day  adjectives,  such as
        good, strong, big, black,  soft,  were  retained,
        but  their  total  number was very small. There was little need
        for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be  arrived
        at   by   adding-ful   to   a  noun-verb.  None  of  the
        now-existing adverbs  was  retained,  except  for  a  very  few
        already   ending  in-wise:  the<span data-line="11340"></span> <span data-line="11340"></span> <span data-line="11340"></span>-wise  termination  was
        invariable. The word well, for example, was replaced  by
        goodwise.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11344"><span data-line="11344"></span>In  addition,  any word — this again applied in principle
        to every word in the language — could be negatived  by  adding
        the  affix  un-  or  could  be strengthened by the affix
        plus-,    or,    for     still     greater     emphasis,
        doubleplus-.  Thus,  for  example,  uncold  meant
        <span data-line="11349"></span>&#8216;_warm&#8217;<span data-line="11349"></span>, while pluscold and doublepluscold  meant,
        respectively, <span data-line="11350"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">very cold</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11350"></span> and <span data-line="11350"></span>&#8216;_superlatively cold&#8217;<span data-line="11350"></span>. It was also
        possible,  as  in present-day English, to modify the meaning of
        almost any word by prepositional affixes such as  ante-,
        post-, up-, down-, etc. By such methods it
        was  found  possible  to  bring about an enormous diminution of
        vocabulary. Given, for instance, the  word  good,  there
        was  no  need for such a word as bad, since the required
        meaning was equally well —  indeed,  better  —  expressed  by
        ungood.  All  that  was necessary, in any case where two
        words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to  decide  which
        of  them  to  suppress.  Dark,  for  example,  could  be
        replaced by unlight, or light  by  undark,
        according to preference.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11364"><span data-line="11364"></span>The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its
        regularity.  Subject  to  a  few exceptions which are mentioned
        below all inflexions followed the  same  rules.  Thus,  in  all
        verbs  the  preterite and the past participle were the same and
        ended  in-ed.  The   preterite   of   steal   was
        stealed,    the    preterite    of    think   was
        thinked, and so on throughout  the  language,  all  such
        forms   as   swam,   gave,   brought,   spoke,
        taken, etc., being abolished.  All  plurals  were  made  by
        adding-s or-es as the case might be. The plurals of man, ox,
        life,   were   mans,   oxes,  lifes.  Comparison  of
        adjectives was  invariably  made  by  adding-er,-est  (good,
        gooder, goodest), irregular forms and the more, most
        formation being suppressed.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11379"><span data-line="11379"></span>The  only  classes  of  words  that  were still allowed to
        inflect irregularly  were  the  pronouns,  the  relatives,  the
        demonstrative adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs. All of these
        followed  their ancient usage, except that whom had been
        scrapped as unnecessary, and the  shall,  should  tenses
        had  been  dropped, all their uses being covered by will
        and would. There were  also  certain  irregularities  in
        word-formation  arising  out  of  the  need  for rapid and easy
        speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was  liable  to
        be  incorrectly  heard,  was held to be ipso facto a bad
        word: occasionally therefore, for the sake  of  euphony,  extra
        letters  were  inserted into a word or an archaic formation was
        retained. But this need made itself felt chiefly  in  connexion
        with  the  B  vocabulary. Why so great an importance was
        attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear  later  in
        this essay.
</p><h5 id="sec-the-b-vocabulary" class="h4" data-line="11396" data-heading-depth="4" style="display:block"><span data-line="11396"></span>The B vocabulary</h5>
<p class="p noindent" data-line="11398"><span data-line="11398"></span>The  B vocabulary consisted of
        words which had been  deliberately  constructed  for  political
        purposes:  words,  that  is to say, which not only had in every
        case a political implication, but were  intended  to  impose  a
        desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without a
        full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult
        to  use  these  words  correctly.  In  some cases they couId be
        translated into Oldspeak, or even into words taken from  the  A
        vocabulary,  but  this  usually  demanded a long paraphrase and
        always involved the loss of certain overtones. The B words were
        a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing whole ranges of ideas
        into a few syllables, and at the same time  more  accurate  and
        forcible than ordinary language.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11412"><span data-line="11412"></span>The B words were in all cases compound words.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11414"><span data-line="11414"></span>They  consisted of two or more words,
        or  portions  of  words,   welded   together   in   an   easily
        pronounceable   form.   The  resulting  amalgam  was  always  a
        noun-verb, and inflected according to the  ordinary  rules.  To
        take a single example: the word goodthink, meaning, very
        roughly,  <span data-line="11419"></span>&#8216;_orthodoxy&#8217;<span data-line="11419"></span>, or, if one chose to regard it as a verb,
        <span data-line="11420"></span>&#8216;_to think in an orthodox manner&#8217;<span data-line="11420"></span>. This  inflected  as  follows:
        noun-verb,  goodthink;  past  tense and past participle,
        goodthinked;    present     participle,     good-
        thinking;    adjective,   goodthinkful;   adverb,
        goodthinkwise; verbal noun, goodthinker.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11426"><span data-line="11426"></span>The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan.
        The words of which they were made up  could  be  any  parts  of
        speech,  and  could be placed in any order and mutilated in any
        way which made them easy to pronounce  while  indicating  their
        derivation.  In  the word crimethink (thoughtcrime), for
        instance,   the   think   came   second,   whereas    in
        thinkpol  Thought  Police)  it  came  first,  and in the
        latter word police had lost its second syllable. Because
        of  the  great  difficuIty  in  securing   euphony,   irregular
        formations  were  commoner  in  the  B vocabulary than in the A
        vocabulary. For example, the adjective  forms  of  Minitrue,
        Minipax,    and    Miniluv    were,    respectively,
        Minitruthful,   Minipeaceful,   and   Minilovely,
        simply because- trueful,-paxful, and-loveful were
        slightly  awkward  to  pronounce.  In principle, however, all B
        words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the same way.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11443"><span data-line="11443"></span>Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely
        intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language  as  a
        whole.  Consider,  for  example, such a typical sentence from a
        Times  leading  article  as  Oldthinkers  unbellyfeel
        Ingsoc.  The shortest rendering that one could make of this
        in Oldspeak would be: <span data-line="11448"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Those whose ideas were formed before the
        Revolution cannot have a full emotional  understanding  of  the
        principles  of  English Socialism.</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11450"></span> But this is not an adequate
        translation. To begin with, in order to
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11453"><span data-line="11453"></span>Compound words  such  as  speakwrite,
        were  of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these were
        merely convenient abbreviations and had no  special  ideologcal
        colour.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11458"><span data-line="11458"></span>grasp  the  full  meaning  of the Newspeak sentence quoted
        above, one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant  by
        Ingsoc.  And  in  addition,  only  a  person  thoroughly
        grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the  word
        bellyfeel,   which   implied   a   blind,   enthusiastic
        acceptance  difficult  to  imagine  today;  or  of   the   word
        oldthink,  which was inextricably mixed up with the idea
        of wickedness  and  decadence.  But  the  special  function  of
        certain  Newspeak  words, of which oldthink was one, was
        not so much to express  meanings  as  to  destroy  them.  These
        words,  necessarily  few  in  number,  had  had  their meanings
        extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries
        of words which, as they were sufficiently covered by  a  single
        comprehensive  term,  could  now be scrapped and forgotten. The
        greatest  difficulty  facing  the  compilers  of  the  Newspeak
        Dictionary  was  not  to invent new words, but, having invented
        them, to make sure what they meant: to make sure,  that  is  to
        say, what ranges of words they cancelled by their existence.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11477"><span data-line="11477"></span>As  we  have  already  seen  in the case of the word free,
        words which had once borne a heretical meaning  were  sometimes
        retained  for  the  sake  of  convenience,  but  only  with the
        undesirable meanings purged out of them. Countless other  words
        such   as   honour,   justice,  morality,  internationalism,
        democracy, science, and religion had  simply  ceased
        to  exist.  A  few blanket words covered them, and, in covering
        them, abolished them. All words grouping themselves  round  the
        concepts  of liberty and equality, for instance, were contained
        in the single word crimethink, while all words  grouping
        themselves  round  the  concepts of objectivity and rationalism
        were contained in  the  single  word  oldthink.  Greater
        precision  would  have  been  dangerous. What was required in a
        Party member was an outlook similar  to  that  of  the  ancient
        Hebrew  who  knew,  without knowing much else, that all nations
        other than his own worshipped <span data-line="11492"></span>&#8216;_false gods&#8217;<span data-line="11492"></span>. He did not need  to
        know   that  these  gods  were  called  Baal,  Osiris,  Moloch,
        Ashtaroth, and the like: probably the less he knew  about  them
        the   better  for  his  orthodoxy.  He  knew  Jehovah  and  the
        commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, that all gods with
        other names or other attributes were false  gods.  In  somewhat
        the  same  way,  the  party  member knew what constituted right
        conduct, and in exceedingly vague, generalized  terms  he  knew
        what kinds of departure from it were possible. His sexual life,
        for  example,  was entirely regulated by the two Newspeak words
        sexcrime (sexual  immorality)  and  goodsex  (chastity).
        Sexcrime   covered  all  sexual  misdeeds  whatever.  It
        covered  fornication,  adultery,   homosexuality,   and   other
        perversions, and, in addition, normal intercourse practised for
        its  own  sake. There was no need to enumerate them separately,
        since they were all equally culpable, and,  in  principle,  all
        punishable  by  death.  In the C vocabulary, which consisted of
        scientific and technical words, it might be necessary  to  give
        specialized  names  to  certain  sexual  aberrations,  but  the
        ordinary citizen had no need of them. He knew what was meant by
        goodsex — that is to say,  normal  intercourse  between
        man  and  wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and
        without physical pleasure on the part of the  woman:  all  else
        was  sexcrime.  In  Newspeak  it  was seldom possible to
        follow a heretical thought further than the perception that  it
        was  heretical:  beyond  that  point  the  necessary words were
        nonexistent.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11520"><span data-line="11520"></span>No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically  neutral.  A
        great  many  were  euphemisms.  Such  words,  for  instance, as
        joycamp (forced-labour camp) or Minipax  Ministry
        of  Peace,  i.  e.  Ministry  of  War)  meant  almost the exact
        opposite of what they appeared to  mean.  Some  words,  on  the
        other hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of
        the   real   nature   of   Oceanic   society.  An  example  was
        prolefeed,  meaning  the  rubbishy   entertainment   and
        spurious  news  which the Party handed out to the masses. Other
        words, again, were ambivalent, having  the  connotation  <span data-line="11529"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">good</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11529"></span>
        when  applied  to  the  Party  and  <span data-line="11530"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">bad</em>&#8217;<span data-line="11530"></span>  when  applied to its
        enemies. But in addition there  were  great  numbers  of  words
        which  at  first  sight  appeared  to be mere abbreviations and
        which derived their ideological colour not from their  meaning,
        but from their structure.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11536"><span data-line="11536"></span>So  far  as  it could be contrived, everything that had or
        might have political significance of any kind was  fitted  into
        the  B  vocabulary.  The name of every organization, or body of
        people, or doctrine, or  country,  or  institution,  or  public
        building, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape; that
        is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of
        syllables  that  would preserve the original derivation. In the
        Ministry of Truth, for  example,  the  Records  Department,  in
        which  Winston  Smith  worked,  was  called  Recdep, the
        Fiction Department was called Ficdep, the Teleprogrammes
        Department was called Teledep, and so on. This  was  not
        done  solely  with the object of saving time. Even in the early
        decades of the twentieth century, telescoped words and  phrases
        had  been  one  of  the  characteristic  features  of political
        language; and it had been noticed  that  the  tendency  to  use
        abbreviations  of  this  kind  was  most marked in totalitarian
        countries and totalitarian organizations.  Examples  were  such
        words  as  Nazi,  Gestapo,  Comin- tern,  Inprecorr,
        Agitprop. In the beginning the practice had been adopted as
        it were instinctively, but in  Newspeak  it  was  used  with  a
        conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a
        name  one  narrowed  and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting
        out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to  it.
        The words Communist International, for instance, call up
        a  composite picture of universal human brotherhood, red flags,
        barricades,  Karl  Marx,  and  the  Paris  Commune.  The   word
        Comintern,   on   the  other  hand,  suggests  merely  a
        tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of  doctrine.
        It  refers  to  something  almost  as easily recognized, and as
        limited in purpose, as a chair or a table. Comintern  is
        a  word  that  can  be  uttered  almost without taking thought,
        whereas Communist International is a phrase  over  which
        one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way,
        the  associations  called up by a word like Minitrue are
        fewer and more controllable than those called up by Ministry
        of  Truth.  This  accounted  not  only  for  the  habit  of
        abbreviating   whenever  possible,  but  also  for  the  almost
        exaggerated care that was  taken  to  make  every  word  easily
        pronounceable.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11576"><span data-line="11576"></span>In  Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other
        than exactitude of meaning. Regularity of  grammar  was  always
        sacrificed  to  it  when  it  seemed necessary. And rightly so,
        since what was required, above all for political purposes,  was
        short  clipped  words  of  unmistakable  meaning which could be
        uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes  in  the
        speaker<span data-line="11582"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11582"></span>s  mind.  The  words of the B vocabulary even gained in
        force from the fact that nearly all  of  them  were  very  much
        alike.  Almost invariably these words — goodthink, Minipax,
        prolefeed,   sexcrime,   joycamp,   Ingsoc,   bellyfeel,
        thinkpol,  and  countless  others  —  were words of two or
        three syllables, with the stress  distributed  equally  between
        the  first  syllable and the last. The use of them encouraged a
        gabbling style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous.  And
        this  was  exactly what was aimed at. The intention was to make
        speech, and especially speech on any subject not  ideologically
        neutral,  as  nearly  as possible independent of consciousness.
        For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or
        sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking,  but  a  Party
        member  called  upon  to  make a political or ethical judgement
        should  be  able  to  spray  forth  the  correct  opinions   as
        automatically  as  a  machine  gun  spraying forth bullets. His
        training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost
        foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with  their
        harsh  sound  and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord
        with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11603"><span data-line="11603"></span>So did the fact of having very few words to  choose  from.
        Relative  to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new
        ways of reducing it were constantly  being  devised.  Newspeak,
        indeed,  differed  from  most  all  other languages in that its
        vocabulary grew smaller instead  of  larger  every  year.  Each
        reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice, the
        smaller the temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped
        to  make  articulate  speech  issue  from  the  larynx  without
        involving the higher brain centres at all. This aim was frankly
        admitted in the Newspeak word duckspeak,  meaning  <span data-line="11612"></span>_<span data-line="11612"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11612"></span>  to
        quack  like  a  duck<span data-line="11613"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11613"></span>.  Like  various  other  words  in  the  B
        vocabulary,  duckspeak  was   ambivalent   in   meaning.
        Provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox
        ones,  it implied nothing but praise, and when The Times
        referred  to  one  of  the  orators   of   the   Party   as   a
        doubleplusgood  duckspeaker  it  was  paying  a warm and
        valued compliment.
</p><h5 id="sec-the-c-vocabulary" class="h4" data-line="11621" data-heading-depth="4" style="display:block"><span data-line="11621"></span>The C vocabulary</h5>
<p class="p noindent" data-line="11623"><span data-line="11623"></span>The C vocabulary was supplementary
        to the  others  and  consisted  entirely  of   scientific   and
        technical  terms.  These  resembled the scientific terms in use
        today, and were constructed from the same roots, but the  usual
        care  was  taken  to  define  them  rigidly  and  strip them of
        undesirable meanings. They followed the same grammatical  rules
        as  the  words in the other two vocabularies. Very few of the C
        words  had  any  currency  either  in  everyday  speech  or  in
        political  speech.  Any  scientific  worker or technician could
        find all the words he needed in the list  devoted  to  his  own
        speciality,  but  he  seldom  had more than a smattering of the
        words occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words  were
        common to all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the
        function of Science as a habit of mind, or a method of thought,
        irrespective  of its particular branches. There was, indeed, no
        word for <span data-line="11638"></span>&#8216;_Science&#8217;<span data-line="11638"></span>, any meaning that  it  could  possibly  bear
        being already sufficiently covered by the word Ingsoc.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11641"><span data-line="11641"></span>From  the  foregoing  account  it  will  be  seen  that in
        Newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions,  above  a  very
        low  level, was well-nigh impossible. It was of course possible
        to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a species of blasphemy.
        It would have been possible, for example, to say Big Brother
        is ungood. But this statement, which  to  an  orthodox  ear
        merely  conveyed  a self-evident absurdity, could not have been
        sustained by reasoned argument,  because  the  necessary  words
        were  not  available.  Ideas  inimical  to Ingsoc could only be
        entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only  be  named
        in  very  broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole
        groups of heresies without  defining  them  in  doing  so.  One
        could,  in  fact,  only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by
        illegitimately  translating  some  of  the  words   back   into
        Oldspeak. For example, All mans are equal was a possible
        Newspeak  sentence,  but only in the same sense in which All
        men are redhaired is a possible  Oldspeak  sentence.
        It  did  not  contain  a  grammatical error, but it expressed a
        palpable untruth-i.e. that all men are of equal  size,  weight,
        or  strength.  The  concept  of  political  equality  no longer
        existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged
        out of the word equal. In 1984, when Oldspeak was  still
        the  normal  means  of  communication, the danger theoretically
        existed that in using Newspeak words one might  remember  their
        original  meanings.  In  practice  it was not difficult for any
        person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this,
        but within a couple of generations even the possibility of such
        a lapse would have vaished. A person growing up  with  Newspeak
        as  his  sole language would no more know that equal had
        once had the secondary meaning of <span data-line="11670"></span>&#8216;_politically equal&#8217;<span data-line="11670"></span>, or  that
        free  had  once  meant  <span data-line="11671"></span>&#8216;_intellectually  free&#8217;<span data-line="11671"></span>, than for
        instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be  aware
        of   the  secondary  meanings  attaching  to  queen  and
        rook. There would be many crimes  and  errors  which  it
        would  be  beyond his power to commit, simply because they were
        nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be  foreseen
        that    with   the   passage   of   time   the   distinguishing
        characteristics  of  Newspeak  would  become  more   and   more
        pronounced — its words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings
        more and more rigid, and the chance of putting them to improper
        uses always diminishing.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11683"><span data-line="11683"></span>When  Oldspeak  had  been once and for all superseded, the
        last link with the past would have been  severed.  History  had
        already  been rewritten, but fragments of the literature of the
        past survived here and there, imperfectly censored, and so long
        as one retained one<span data-line="11687"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11687"></span>s knowledge of Oldspeak it was possible  to
        read  them.  In the future such fragments, even if they chanced
        to survive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable. It  was
        impossible  to  translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak
        unless it either referred to some  technical  process  or  some
        very   simple   everyday   action,   or  was  already  orthodox
        (goodthinkful  would  be  the  NewsPeak  expression)  in
        tendency.  In  practice  this meant that no book written before
        approximately  1960   could   be   translated   as   a   whole.
        Pre-revolutionary   literature   could  only  be  subjected  to
        ideological translation — that is, alteration in sense as well
        as language. Take for example the well-known passage  from  the
        Declaration of Independence:
</p>
<blockquote data-line="11701">

<p class="p noindent" data-line="11701"><span data-line="11701"></span>We  hold  these truths to be self-evident, that all men
        are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator  with
        certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty,
        and  the  pursuit  of  happiness.  That to secure these rights,
        Governments are instituted among  men,  deriving  their  powers
        from  the  consent  of  the governed. That whenever any form of
        Government becomes destructive of those ends, it is  the  right
        of  the  People  to  alter  or abolish it, and to institute new
        Government…
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11711"><span data-line="11711"></span>It would have been quite impossible to  render  this  into
        Newspeak  while  keeping  to  the  sense  of  the original. The
        nearest one could come to doing so  would  be  to  swallow  the
        whole  passage  up in the single word crimethink. A full
        translation could only be an ideological  translation,  whereby
        Jefferson<span data-line="11716"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11716"></span>s words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute
        government.
</p>
<p class="p indent" data-line="11719"><span data-line="11719"></span>A  good  deal  of  the literature of the past was, indeed,
        already  being  transformed  in  this  way.  Considerations  of
        prestige  made  it  desirable to preserve the memory of certain
        historical figures, while  at  the  same  time  bringing  their
        achievements  into  line with the philosophy of Ingsoc. Various
        writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton,  Swift,  Byron,  Dickens,
        and  some others were therefore in process of translation: when
        the task had been completed, their original writings, with  all
        else  that  survived  of  the  literature of the past, would be
        destroyed.  These  translations  were  a  slow  and   difficult
        business,  and  it was not expected that they would be finished
        before the first or second decade of the twenty-first  century.
        There   were   also  large  quantities  of  merely  utilitarian
        literature — indispensable technical manuals, and the like  —
        that had to be treated in the same way. It was chiefly in order
        to  allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the
        final adoption of Newspeak had been fixed for so late a date as
        2050.
